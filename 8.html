            <h2>CONSEQUENCES OF NUCLEAR ENERGY</h2>

            <p>As explained earlier, the energies generated by a body in motion are extracted in the form of bubbles of energy which are neutral in respect to the other bubbles extracted from the same body, however, the size of the bubbles are directly proportional to the size of the body from which they've been extracted. This means that larger bodies produce larger bubbles, and so we can place values on these bubbles and say that some bubbles are negative in respect to bubbles produced by other bodies, ie., they are smaller. By the same method we can say that some bubbles are positive in respect to bubbles produced by other bodies, ie., they are larger. This terminology is very important for the reader to understand, so that the information you've received will be easily understood. It is vital that the people who read these pages come to see the larger picture. It's not just the ionosphere that's in danger ­it is all of the combined systems of the earth altering their normally balanced cycles. The entire planet earth is at risk in this crisis, so it's imperative that the reader comprehends the way in which the various systems interweave and how they are therefore all out of balance, and it will take a major effort to put these cycles back into a proper balance. Once the processes are understood, the true magnitude of the problem becomes apparent.</p>

            <p>During the process of fission, a neutron is hurled at the nucleus of a uranium (or plutonium) atom and it divides that mass. In this process neutrons and protons are destroyed and their energies released. After studying falling bodies and atomic structure it should be apparent that these enormous amounts of energy released in fission are the result of the many systems of particles within the neutron or proton being forced out of their orbits and turned loose into the environment in a highly unstable state. Also, it should be clear that many of these systems are completely destroyed, leaving only highly energetic, very minute particles moving at incredible velocities. These particles and very minute, unstable systems move off in all directions ­ some to pass through water to create steam, some down into the core of the earth, and some straight through the walls of the containment vessels and into the atmosphere.</p>

            <p>In each and every fission reaction, approximately twenty protons and neutrons are shattered, the exact number depends upon the type of material being used. The average proton or neutron contains approximately twenty-two thousand particles, so do some math and you'll quickly see how many trillions of these unstable particles and systems are being forcefully introduced into our ecosystem per micro­second, worldwide.</p>

            <p>We earlier carefully explained that any unstable system will immediately attempt to balance itself, and for many of these newly destabilized particles and systems this attempt begins as they pass through the walls of the containment vessels. Here again the jipsee systems are a major factor, for as these minute particles and systems of particles stream through the walls they are already in the process of re­assimilation into larger, more balanced systems. While engaged in this process, the jipsee systems in the atoms which form the containment vessel walls are very strongly attracted to these highly unstable systems, and often leave their orbits to assemble and attempt to balance these very unstable systems and particles. This means that from the moment a nuclear plant begins operations, the walls of the containment vessels begin to weaken so that as time passes they also become unstable and allow ever larger and larger systems and particles to escape unopposed.</p>

            <p>To briefly address the question of where these particles and systems go once beyond the containment walls, we would begin by considering those which travel inward ­ towards the core of the earth. In the segment on falling bodies we discussed the cycle of energy exchange experienced by a body in motion, and stated that under normal conditions the rate of extraction is balanced with the rate of energy input (at the poles) and that this cycle is tied directly to the velocity and rotational rate of the body. If the reader understands this cycle, they will also be able to clearly see that as these particles move into the core, they are disrupting this normally balanced cycle. More input energy, no matter the source of input, forces the planet to generate more extracted energy to attempt to compensate. The rate of the extraction directly affects the rate of the rotation, so as the energy extraction becomes progressively accelerated, the rotation rate will follow suit. As the cycle completes Itself and the extra energy extracted now returns as input energy (approx. 10­12 years), this extra level of input, combined with the continuous additional input energy from nuclear fission ensures that the problem will continue to be progressive.</p>

            <p>We estimate that 15% of the extra energy forced into the cycle by the use of nuclear fission remains in a state which is negative in respect to the normal energy output of this planet, and though this percent of negativity has its undesirable effects, it is the Increased rate of energy exchange which most concerns us now. As should be apparent to the reader at this point, an increased rate of energy exchange and rate of rotation will cause an increase in the repulsive force exerted by the falling body. As the repulsive force increases the body moves farther away from its nucleus, which in our case is the sun. If the orbit of this planet expands, it cannot help but affect the orbits of the other planets in the system, particularly our closest neighbors.</p>

            <p>Of the many highly energetic particles and systems released through fission, many travel toward the moon, and because the moon and its extracted energy are very negative in respect to planet earth, some of these energetic, still unstable particles and systems are readily accepted by the moon as input energy. This will increase the cycle of energy exchange in the moon, once again resulting in a greater repulsive force generated by that body. Clearly, the moon cannot fail to move farther away from the earth. The tides, (which are erroneously said to be caused by the gravity of the moon "pulling" at earth) are becoming ever more severe, but this is only the beginning. As the repulsive forces of earth and moon continue to increase, the Interaction between them (which is the true reason for earth tides) will cause the tidal cycles to become increasingly dangerous to coastal dwellers. This new balance of interactions between the respective fields of earth and moon will also increase the degree of earth wobble, but the position and field of the sun is also a major factor in this equation, and so will be considered after solar structure has been fully addressed.</p>

            <!-- Continue with more content as needed -->

            <p>When we further consider where these particles and systems go, we must mention that some of the smallest and most energetic move straight out of the earth's gravitational field and speed toward the sun. Clearly, these systems are very highly negative in respect to the sun, and are repelled at incredible velocities back toward the earth/moon system, it is known that particles of energy from the cosmos travel in vortexes, yet experimenters deep in the earth (searching for proton decay) are picking up readings of energies coming into the earth in a straight line. They are speculating these are from some galaxy out there, but in reality they are detecting these high speed particles now repelled and accelerated, returning to haunt us all, and disrupt yet more earth cycles.</p>

            <p>The great majority of the particles and systems under consideration here find a home in the upper reaches of the ionosphere. It must be remembered that these systems and particles of which we speak are various sizes and moving at various velocities, but are all very negative in respect to earth. Some of the faster moving particles and systems have converted to photons of energy (bubbles) and when they collide with the normal ozone (03) they quickly break it down into its singular element (0). The single oxygen atom is an electrical isotope, and so carries a positive charge, and will readily assimilate with any element, particle, or system of particles that are available. At the same time as these events are occurring the slower moving particles and systems are attempting to restabilize, and are reforming into more complex, balanced systems. They come together at such a high velocity (but less than that of light) that the newly assembled neutrons are not neutral, but are slightly negative. These negative neutrons quickly seek out proton systems, and often form into nuclei systems before the proton is completely assembled, ie., while it still has a higher than ideal charge. Our calculations indicate that the average newly created but mutated nuclei system would consist of two slightly negative neutrons and one proton. Because of this instability, the various jipsee systems are very active trying to achieve order, and in the process begins throwing off systems and particles. If these were normal nuclei systems we would have a hydrogen atom, but they are not normal­ \- they are highly unstable (radio­active) isotopes of hydrogen, and an investigation of this new element will reveal it has an atomic weight nearly that of helium. Being much larger than the normal hydrogen nuclei, they will also attract more and larger electron systems than would normal hydrogen.</p>

            <p>Some of these newly formed, strange elements are forming into molecules with the single oxygen atoms available, creating an abnormal variation of (H3)2 0, which will eventually return to earth as radio­active rain. This, much more than acid rain (which is also a factor) is taking its toll on the plant life of earth. Other of these singular elements of oxygen are directly receiving the single particles released through fission. Once residing in the oxygen nucleus they attempt to stabilize by gathering more stray particles and building new larger and larger systems within the nucleus. Eventually this process produces new proton and neutron systems which find stability as fluorine. Other chemical reactions will also result in formation of these fluorine atoms, which are able very readily divide existing O3 molecules into their singular elements, thus perpetuating the abnormal cycle. Here again, a problem which was serious enough becomes progressively more dangerous.</p>

            <p>Due to various factors, many of the trillions of particles released through fission do not immediately assimilate into larger systems, and these, being highly negative to earth and even more negative in respect to the sun, tend to "settle in" near areas which are away from direct contact with the sun's energy. On earth this means that they will prefer to “settle in” near the pole which lies in darkness at the moment. Here they assemble themselves, but now, without the impedance of the full strength of the sun's repulsive force, the result is a very negative plasma. When the sun again returns to whichever pole is involved, the surface of the earth below is warmed. The air is lighter, and the lighter elements and molecules of the ionosphere begin to move earthward in massive quantities. The very negative plasma is, of course, more highly negative to the sun than to the earth, and therefore when it is brought into contact with the sun's greater repulsive force, it is forced earthward. The final result of this movement is a large "crack" in the ionosphere which will begin to open as soon as the area in question begins its summer. It will reach its height during the mid­summer, and will begin to close only when the sun again leaves the area in darkness, allowing the negative plasma to be repelled from earth back into the ionosphere. These polar ionospheric "cracks" will continue to grow progressively larger each year until actions are taken to restore balance.</p>

            <p>These cracks in the ionosphere are serious enough, but once more we find there are other factors which compound the problem. In this case it is the tendency of these particles to be attracted to areas where there are large deposits of ferrous metals below, and here they assemble into negative plasma. They will be most strongly attracted to any of these areas which are surrounded by water. This is a symptom which we hadn't expected to see manifested until 1987, or perhaps even 1988, but evidently there are multitudes more unstable particles being released through nuclear weapons tests, faulty reactors, and radio­active wastes than anyone is aware of, because now it's been reported that a hole has developed over Norway. If this is indeed the case, then be assured ­ there are others. Many of them will be found to have developed over the oceans and seas, where ferrous metals lie beneath the ocean/sea floor. All life below these holes in the ionosphere are at extreme risk, so these areas must be identified ­ and quickly.</p>

            <p>Some of the effects of the massive disruption of the systems on earth have been stated earlier ­ others have not ­ but the reader should clearly see what their future holds, so some of these things bear repetition. The ill effects felt by the planet earth will manifest themselves in progressively more violent reactions. Perhaps the most serious of these will be a direct result of the increased rate of energy exchange. Already this is causing a steady increase in the internal pressure of the planet, which will be periodically (and increasingly regularly) relieved through earthquakes and volcanic actions. This pressure will create more heat within the earth which will (or already is) cause the surface of the planet to warm, and the ice caps to begin to melt. Besides contributing to an increase in the ocean levels, this warming will also cause disrupted and abnormal weather patterns which, coupled with the increasingly severe tidal cycles, will cause coastal areas to begin to disappear.</p>

            <p>As the energy exchange of the planet increases, the magnetic field of earth will continue to change. This will Increasingly affect the many different species of life which rely on the magnetic field for their sense of direction, and it is quite possible that some species of whales are already experiencing difficulties in navigation. Oceanic species sensitive to changing water temperatures will begin to experience shock due to rising water temperatures. Those that cannot quickly adapt will die, while mobile species will be forced to migrate to cooler waters. This will overtax the ecosystems, and many of these creatures will also die.</p>

            <p>Land based species face other dangers. We have shown an outline of atomic structure, as well as some of the effects these fission-freed particles and systems can have on atomic structures. Now we would remind the reader that each and every cell, and every molecule of DMA in their body is but a conglomeration of atoms which are subject to the same laws ­ and the same injuries ­ as are all other atoms. Unlike the sun, our bodies generate no strong repulsive force to ward off these high velocity, unstable particles and systems, and we are even less dense than a containment vessel, and so offer no barrier to these fission released systems. As they move through a body they continue to attempt to stabilize, which means they will either try to join existing systems, carry off jipsee systems as they pass through, or in cases where their velocities are too high to allow either of these options, will simply displace and disrupt systems they encounter. For humans and other species living in close proximity to a nuclear reactor the odds of developing a fatal disease are vastly Increased ­ for the Immune system will be unable to function under conditions of constant disruptions. These people will also show a higher incidence of genetic defects among their offspring \-­ some obvious (blindness), and others hidden (immune system deficiencies, etc.). Since the brain also operates with these same bubbles of neutral energy we've taken pains to explain, its functions can be easily disrupted by introduction of foreign bubbles and particles, causing ever increasing crime and accident rates in areas of high doses, as well as insanity, suicidal behavior, and even brain damage. Always remember that nothing short of the repulsive action of the sun will stop or deflect these unstable systems and particles» so we are all completely at their mercy ­ every day ­ and so is every other living creature on this planet.</p>

            <p>There is so very much more to be said, but the time element is so critical that this will have to suffice for the time being. These past months our research team has worked frantically to sound the alarm, and our focus has been on antinuclear, environmental, peace, and disarmament groups and outspoken individuals, but the response rate has been very discouraging, until just recently. Our first round of mailings were very poorly received, and it's possible that the reason for this was that we stated confidently that if this insanity continued, we could set off a chain reaction which could split this planet, the solar system, and perhaps even the galaxy and universe. Perhaps this was viewed as too impossible to be true, we can't know for certain what caused the apathetic attitude towards our warning, but it doesn't matter now. All that does matter is that we were not joking, and we were not exaggerating. The total and instantaneous destruction of this planet is not only a possibility ­ it is an eventual absolute certainty, and we will now explain why.</p>

            <p>In the same manner as other new atoms are forming in the ionosphere from the particles released through fission, so are H, H2 (deuterium), and H3 (tritium) being produced in large quantities, and with each passing minute, more and more are accumulating. If anyone doubts the truth of this statement, then find a way to take samples, and prove it to yourself ­ the element is there, and in great quantities. Now recall that in 1956 Dr. Luis Alvarez and his team produced cold fusion in their University of California radiation laboratory. The fusion was between light hydrogen (H) and heavy hydrogen (H2), and it was accomplished by passing a cosmic ray through cold hydrogen. It is a commonly known fact that H2 and H3 very easily fuse. A cosmic ray is nothing more than a negatively charged mu meson, which our team has determined is a very small, high velocity jipsee system. Tests have proven that hydrogen can be fused by the impact of these high velocity particles and systems, which we have explained are in great abundance ­ as is hydrogen ­ and all caused by fission. When a high velocity jipsee system (cosmic ray) Impacts with hydrogen in such a way as to cause a single fusion in the ionosphere, the entire planet can be engulfed in a huge hydrogen explosion from which there will be no survivors. When this happens (and we say "when" because It's only a matter of time before it does) the resulting explosion will immediately engulf the moon as well. With the destruction of the repulsive fields of earth and moon, they will immediately begin their plunge into the nucleus of our solar system. This in turn will cause the fission of our nucleus, the sun, which will then become a giant pulsar.</p>

            <p>Our calculations are not yet complete, but preliminary indications are that the sudden and massive disruption of this solar system could quite possibly set off a chain reaction which we cannot predict the boundary of.</p>

            <p>In coping with the dangers which threaten, several emergency steps must be taken immediately, and the most urgent of these are a complete ban on all weapons testing worldwide, and a total shutdown of all nuclear reactors. This must be done forthwith, as these are the most likely means of igniting the ionosphere. From there on the strategy is clear ­ we must begin to repair the damage. The technology now exists which will allow these repairs but we must have allies, for alone we can do nothing \! It is time for the people of this planet to join together and work together on the common goals. The responsibility has fallen to us, and we must not fall. Our only hope is to begin a worldwide, coordinated effort, for if we don't, our future is assured. We can no longer sit back, lulled by the false belief that our trusted institutions will "fix" it, because they won't, or they already would have begun. It seems clear that the Soviet Union is well aware of the real possibility of fusing the ionosphere at any moment, and they have reacted by stopping all nuclear testing and are literally begging the United States to do the same. They have warned that this nation's pursuit of "Star Wars" testing could set off a fire which would engulf the earth, and are pleading that this country abandon these goals. Their fears are very well founded \-­ this is not some political game they're playing \! If you've studied our preliminary work it should be obvious to you that perhaps the worst thing this country can do is to be shooting high energy beams through our highly unstable ionosphere, yet they persist. If the Soviet Union is aware of the immediate danger, then is it possible that the United States is not ? Form your own conclusions, and then consider that perhaps it is time we asked the Soviet people just what they have found out about the status of this planet. If we the people cannot find a way to work together when every form of life on this planet Is facing certain death, then we must ask ourselves if such a species is worth saving.</p>

            <p>A small generator was built and tested, and we can produce the repulsive force. The theory is correct, and the technologies which will allow us to save ourselves waits to be developed. If you harbor doubts about the truth of what we assert, then we invite you to do everything in your power to prove us wrong. In the process you will become convinced that we are correct, and at that point we will very much welcome your participation in Project Stardust.</p>
