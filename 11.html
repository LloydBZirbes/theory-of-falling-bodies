            <h2>Beyond the Ionosphere</h2>

            <p>Existing around earth (and all planets) is a neutral belt of radiation. Measuring from the equator of earth outward, the outer edge of earth's belt is approximately 40,000 miles high, and under normal conditions would be roughly 100 miles thick. The "layers" of this belt are "locked" into existing shells of the earth's magnetic field. This belt acts to shield the earth from energy generated by the sun (see segment four) in that it offers a resistance to the neutral solar radiation, thus slowing its velocity. Some of this solar radiation is slowed enough to become mass, and is "trapped" within the belt. Each layer of the belt will tend to accumulate a given sized particle: finer particles will be found closest to the outer layer of the belt: larger particles in a layer closer to the inner layer of the belt.</p>

            <p>Once converted to mass, all particles seek to stabilize into systems. The fine particles in the outer layers of the belt are not yet assembled into systems, and are therefore neutral, and will be repelled from the north and south poles of the earth. Their velocity is great, and they continue their motion, but now they're held within a layer of the belt and so instead of moving in their previous direction, are now confined to moving along the length of the belt. As they approach one pole in this journey, they are repelled, and so reverse direction. As they then near the opposite pole they are again repulsed, and again reverse their direction of motion. This movement occurs at a tremendous velocity, and the repulsion by the poles ensures the continuation of the oscillation of these fine particles back and forth along the length of their particular layer of the belt. Their velocity remains fairly constant, being very near .9 times the velocity of light, but even at this velocity assimilation of particles through collision occurs, and these very fine particles begin to assemble into minute systems of particles.</p>
 <p>Once a particle joins other particles and creates a system, it is no longer neutral, and now begins to respond to the gravitational attraction of the earth. This attraction encourages the new system to filter through to a lower layer of the belt, closer to earth. The new system now carries an electrical charge, but it is so minute as to be a negligible factor, and oscillations along the length of their present position within the belt continues, but the velocity will have decreased somewhat. This weight gain and subsequent reduction in velocity allows for more rapid assimilation into larger and yet larger systems of particles. With each increase in weight (i.e.: additional mini-systems added), the developing system of particles will be more responsive to the gravitational attraction of earth, and will filter through subsequent layers of the belt, moving ever closer to earth as the system develops into a more complex system.</p>

            <p>By the time the original fine particle reaches the layer of the belt nearest to earth, it is a member of a complex neutron or proton system, and has undergone a dramatic reduction of velocity during its passage through the layers of the belt. Proton systems will be attracted to the north pole, while neutron systems will be attracted to the south pole. As they move toward their respective attracting pole along this final belt, some will find that their weight and slow velocity can no longer resist the gravitational attraction of the planet as a whole. These systems will then leave the belt at some point along its length and will spiral earthward, where they will continue their assimilation with other systems of particles, eventually forming atoms and then ever more complex structures.</p>

            <p>Other systems within the belt proceed toward their attracting pole, and their velocity once again increases as they near the pole and feel the attraction grow stronger. At this point it must be recalled that every falling body experiences a flow of energy whereby energy is extracted at the leading edge of the fall, cycles around the body (creating the gravitational field), and then re-enters the body as input energy. During this cycle many different energies join the flow (both polarized and neutral energies from various sources) and are carried along to ultimately approach a pole area. As this energy approaches a pole it begins to lose velocity, and any neutral energy within the flow polarizes. This loss of velocity occurs because of the extreme congestion within the narrow corridor leading to a pole, which must accommodate energy input from the gravitational field cycle, mass from the radiation belt, and energy input from other sources which are too numerous to be discussed at this time. This corridor is therefore an area of high turbulence, as input energy from all quarters converges here. While neutral energies from the gravitational field are slowing and polarizing, mass from the radiation belt is speeding up, and most of it will convert to energy. Collisions are ongoing, as all of the input is compressed into this relatively small area - still miles above the earth's atmosphere.</p>

            <p>For the sake of clarity this re-entry will be described in terms of undergoing three different phases. In reality however, it should be realized that re-entry happens very quickly, and one phase blends into the next - none are completely distinct and separate from the others. The general positions of energies during these three "phases" of re-entry are shown in figure one.</p>

            <img src="img/fig1.jpg" alt="Figure 1: Phases of re-entry">

            <p>During the first phase (yellow), all of the input energies begin to converge as they approach the corridor, and neutral energies begin to polarize. At this point the energies, if measured, would prove to be of very short frequencies, invisible to the human eye. Phase two (orange) finds all of this polarized energy jammed into the narrow space of the corridor proper, where it encounters the input from the radiation belt which is accelerating and forming into short frequency energy. During this phase the short frequency energies from these two sources (and the misc. sources) begin to "bump" into and join with one another, forming longer frequency energy, which comes within the spectrum of light visible to the eye. On earth we have named phase two the aurora borealis, whose presence depends upon the sized frequency being formed, and whose intensity depends upon the amount of input energy being introduced. As this energy now nears the outer atmosphere in its third phase (blue), it encounters additional resistance from mass contained therein, which slows the energies down a bit more. This results in a combining of the mid-sized energy frequencies into yet longer frequencies which again move out of the visual range, causing the aurora to seem to "disappear". The polarized energy then enters the earth to fill the void caused by the extraction of energy, and the cycle continues in perfect balance indefinitely, or until it's disrupted forcibly by outside interference, as has happened in the case of planet earth.</p>

            <p>Until the first nuclear war in the mid 1940's, the radiation belt surrounding earth functioned perfectly - as just described. For the next decade bomb testing continued, as man played with his new toy - fission. When Dr. Van Allen undertook to measure the radiation belt, he discovered there were two belts surrounding earth, and made public his findings. Murmurings among the technicians involved with the project caused concerns that the lower belt may be the result of nuclear fission debris.</p>

            <!-- Previous content remains the same -->

            <p>Perhaps to still rising doubts about nuclear fission and fusion, a project code named Argus was carried out in Aug.-Sept. 1958, where three hydrogen bombs were exploded in space beneath the lower area of the Van Allen belts. The project itself was top secret, but its effects were not. The fused material produced by these explosions was of course very heavy as compared with other fission produced material within the belt, and so it settled in at a lower layer of the magnetic field which had previously been void of debris. Being so near earth and very heavy, this fusion debris was very rapidly channeled back into earth as input. Atmospheric scientists who knew nothing of Argus detected great streaks of lithium in the especially brilliant aurora borealis which occurred on the heels of Argus. Puzzled and fearful, these scientists quickly announced that there was severe fusion occurring in the radiation belt. News of Argus did not come to light until some years later, and is still shrouded in some mystery. Two of the most obvious questions which remain to be answered are, why did they do it, and so they yet realize how very close they may have come to fusing the entire radiation belt and setting off a reaction which could have fused the oceans of earth?</p>

            <p>In 1962, the scientists involved with the space and nuclear programs again measured the radiation "belts", but now found there was only one huge belt, some 35,000 miles thick. It was loudly proclaimed that Van Allen had been incorrect in his measurements, and that he'd mistaken the one large belt for two separate belts. Van Allen was correct. At the time he took his readings there were two belts - one natural and one (the lower) unnatural - full of fission debris. By 1962 the large area between those two belts had been filled in by the vast amounts of fissioned material produced on earth, which then spread out around earth – each different particle finding a niche (layer) within the magnetic field suitable to its particular weight and/or stage of assimilation. The very lowest layers were now also filled in, but these contained fused material created through hydrogen bomb testing. These are very heavy (and close to earth) being more fully assimilated, and contain more complex systems - including basic elements and some simple compounds. Figures two-five attempt to show the stages in the deliberate and ongoing destruction of earth's protective shield, the radiation belt.</p>

            <img src="img/fig5.jpg" alt="Figure 5: Stages in the destruction of Earth's radiation belt">

            <p>When measurements were taken again in 1962 it was found that there now existed only one huge belt, for by this time ongoing fission programs on earth had added vast quantities of new fission debris to the radiation belt, and the space between the natural and fission belts was beginning to fill in.</p>

            <p>Today, thanks to the efforts of university teams and other research facilities, the presence of nuclear debris at least in the lower belt is grudgingly admitted by our nation's "responsible" agencies to be the result of the nuclear programs, but concerns for this fact, if any exists, are brushed aside with the old "catch all" argument that nuclear energy is a natural energy. This argument continues on to assure any citizens who are aware enough to be concerned that since fission and fusion are nature's favorite tools, that nature also has built-in mechanisms for balancing out little problems like debris in radiation belts. We fully agree that nature will restore balance, but it will not be in the quiet manner our very learned leaders expect. Nature is about to begin making a great deal of noise, and this brings us to the subject of how restoration of balance will be achieved.</p>

            <p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>

            <p>To facilitate this discussion, the overlapping sections of the radiation belt (fig. 5) will be spoken of as though they were three distinct belts.</p>

            <!-- The rest of the content will be added in subsequent chunks -->

            <p>All three sections of the radiation belt (natural, fission, and fusion) contribute constant input to the pole areas. Earth has no mechanisms for regulating the flow, relying completely on a balanced system (and balanced input), so when the system is not balanced, earth must continue to accept all offerings. Due to the existence and constant input of the unnatural belts the corridors leading to the poles are highly congested (as are the belts themselves) and velocities are reduced. Lesser velocity and more collisions allow many of the protons and neutrons from the natural and fission belts to begin assimilation into more complex systems even before their arrival in the corridor. This additional weight coupled with a further reduction in velocity upon entering the tightly packed corridor prevent many of these systems from converting to energy. Instead, they will collide with similar (highly isotopic) systems in the corridor and continue assimilation with these systems. Many are still incomplete when they reach the earth's atmosphere, but others have managed to assimilate into simple elements, notably forms of hydrogen. These elements are formed under unnatural, extreme conditions, and investigation would reveal that super heavy, abnormal forms of hydrogen are entering earth's atmosphere from these corridors in a steady stream.</p>

            <p>While the natural and fission belt inputs are building elements, the heavier, more complex systems from the fusion belt enter the corridor as low velocity, "fused" elements in a highly unstable state. Here they also collide and assimilate with similar systems and form ever more complex systems, including helium, lithium, and beryllium - many of which will also be abnormally heavy, strange elements.</p>

            <p>The remaining input from the belts which are not sufficiently slowed to have achieved any great degree of assimilation will be the most easily converted to energy when struck by incoming (gravitational cycle) energies. These energies will then follow the same process described earlier - polarizing, forming frequencies, and joining the other quantities and forms of input in producing spectacular lithium and beryllium streaked auroras.</p>

            <p>When these isotopic systems, elements, (and compounds) enter the ionosphere, they collide with the many elements and compounds already present in great abundance, and continue assimilation - forming more complex fluorine, neon, and chlorine (etc.) systems. These chemicals are bombarded constantly by both incoming and by outgoing (fission released) particles exported from earth (see segment three).</p>

            <p>The net effect of this extreme disorder is an ionosphere experiencing ongoing and abnormal chemical reactions which result in the creation of negative plasmas, fusible hydrogen, and destructive elements and compounds. As long as fission and fusion continue to be the favorite toys of earth leaders, the turbulence in the ionosphere will continue to become progressively worse.</p>

            <p>All of this extra input also affects the corridor itself, which is important because it is causing the corridor to warm. As the temperature within this great avenue rises, so also will the temperature of the atmosphere through which it passes begin to warm. The land mass below cannot fail to follow suit as- this process progresses, and the cumulative effect of this overall warming will force the ice caps to begin to melt. If this is already being noted, expect it to become exponentially more rapid as earth's cycles become increasingly perverted.</p>

            <p>In the past we've tried to show the great interrelation between the major cycles of earth, and their control over all other minor cycles. The overriding cycle is the input/output cycle which determines the gravitational field (and hence repulsive force), this rotation rate, and the value of the magnetic field. Its importance therefore cannot be overstated. It is this grandfather cycle - the basic foundation of all other cycles - which is being directly attacked by fission and fusion. Until only recently the observable effects of this destruction were small, seemingly unrelated warning signs - easily rationalized. Now, however, earth is approaching a critical juncture where rationalizations will no longer satisfy anyone.</p>

            <img src="img/fig6.jpg" alt="Figure 6: Earth's cycles and the effects of fission and fusion">

            <p>Once fission or fusion disrupts an atomic system, releasing unstable particles, we are saddled with them indefinitely, for they seldom escape earth's gravitational field (bubble). Those that were not repelled back to earth, picked up by the radiation belt, or settled in at the poles, have joined the flow of the gravitational field cycle, and now also return as extra input energy. At this most critical juncture we face a situation where the radiation belts are full, the gravitational flow is overloaded, and the corridors can no longer maintain any sort of order. Meanwhile, earth operations continue unabated, pumping tremendous quantities of yet more of these particles into an already dangerously overloaded system. The result is clear - our foundation has begun to crumble.</p>
