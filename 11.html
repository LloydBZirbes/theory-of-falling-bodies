            <h2>Beyond the Ionosphere</h2>

            <p>Existing around earth (and all planets) is a neutral belt of radiation. Measuring from the equator of earth outward, the outer edge of earth's belt is approximately 40,000 miles high, and under normal conditions would be roughly 100 miles thick. The "layers" of this belt are "locked" into existing shells of the earth's magnetic field. This belt acts to shield the earth from energy generated by the sun (see segment four) in that it offers a resistance to the neutral solar radiation, thus slowing its velocity. Some of this solar radiation is slowed enough to become mass, and is "trapped" within the belt. Each layer of the belt will tend to accumulate a given sized particle : finer particles will be found closest to the outer layer of the belt: larger particles in a layer closer to the inner layer of the belt.</p>

            <p>Once converted to mass, all particles seek to stabilize into systems. The fine particles in the outer layers of the belt are not yet assembled into systems, and are therefore neutral, and will be repelled from the north and south poles of the earth. Their velocity is great, and they continue their motion, but now they're held within a layer of the belt and so instead of moving in their previous direction, are now confined to moving along the length of the belt. As they approach one pole in this journey, they are repelled, and so reverse direction. As they then near the opposite pole they are again repulsed, and again reverse their direction of motion. This movement occurs at a tremendous velocity, and the repulsion by the poles ensures the continuation of the oscillation of these fine particles back and forth along the length of their particular layer of the belt. Their velocity remains fairly constant, being very near .9 times the velocity of light, but even at this velocity assimilation of particles through collision occurs, and these very fine particles begin to assemble into minute systems of particles.</p>

            <p>Once a particle joins other particles and creates a system, it is no longer neutral, and now begins to respond to the gravitational attraction of the earth. This attraction encourages the new system to filter through to a lower layer of the belt, closer to earth. The new system now carries an electrical charge, but it is so minute as to be a negligible factor, and oscillations along the length of their present position within the belt continues, but the velocity will have decreased somewhat. This weight gain and subsequent reduction in velocity allows for more rapid assimilation into larger and yet larger systems of particles. With each increase in weight (i.e.: additional mini-systems added), the developing system of particles will be more responsive to the gravitational attraction of earth, and will filter through subsequent layers of the belt, moving ever closer to earth as the system develops into a more complex system.</p>

            <p>By the time the original fine particle reaches the layer of the belt nearest to earth, it is a member of a complex neutron or proton system, and has undergone a dramatic reduction of velocity during its passage through the layers of the belt. Proton systems will be attracted to the north pole, while neutron systems will be attracted to the south pole. As they move toward their respective attracting pole along this final belt, some will find that their weight and slow velocity can no longer resist the gravitational attraction of the planet as a whole. These systems will then leave the belt at some point along its length and will spiral earthward, where they will continue their assimilation with other systems of particles, eventually forming atoms and then ever more complex structures.</p>

            <p>Other systems within the belt proceed toward their attracting pole, and their velocity once again increases as they near the pole and feel the attraction grow stronger. At this point it must be recalled that every falling body experiences a flow of energy whereby energy is extracted at the leading edge of the fall, cycles around the body (creating the gravitational field), and then re-enters the body as input energy. During this cycle many different energies join the flow (both polarized and neutral energies from various sources) and are carried along to ultimately approach a pole area. As this energy approaches a pole it begins to lose velocity, and any neutral energy within the flow polarizes. This loss of velocity occurs because of the extreme congestion within the narrow corridor leading to a pole, which must accommodate energy input from the gravitational field cycle, mass from the radiation belt, and energy input from other sources which are too numerous to be discussed at this time. This corridor is therefore an area of high turbulence, as input energy from all quarters converges here. While neutral energies from the gravitational field are slowing and polarizing, mass from the radiation belt is speeding up, and most of it will convert to energy. Collisions are ongoing, as all of the input is compressed into this relatively small area ­ still miles above the earth's atmosphere.</p>

            <p>For the sake of clarity this re-entry will be described in terms of undergoing three different phases. In reality however, it should be realized that re-entry happens very quickly, and one phase blends into the next ­ none are completely distinct and separate from the others. The general positions of energies during these three "phases" of re-entry are shown in figure one.</p>

            <!-- Note: There's no figure one in the provided content. If you have this figure, you can insert it here. -->

            <p>During the first phase (yellow), all of the input energies begin to converge as they approach the corridor, and neutral energies begin to polarize. At this point the energies, if measured, would prove to be of very short frequencies, invisible to the human eye. Phase two (orange) finds all of this polarized energy jammed into the narrow space of the corridor proper, where it encounters the input from the radiation belt which is accelerating and forming into short frequency energy. During this phase the short frequency energies from these two sources (and the misc. sources) begin to "bump" into and join with one another, forming longer frequency energy, which comes within the spectrum of light visible to the eye. On earth we have named phase two the aurora borealis, whose presence depends upon the sized frequency being formed, and whose intensity depends upon the amount of input energy being introduced. As this energy now nears the outer atmosphere in its third phase (blue), it encounters additional resistance from mass contained therein, which slows the energies down a bit more. This results in a combining of the mid-sized energy frequencies into yet longer frequencies which again move out of the visual range, causing the aurora to seem to "disappear". The polarized energy then enters the earth to fill the void caused by the extraction of energy, and the cycle continues in perfect balance indefinitely, or until it's disrupted forcibly by outside interference, as has happened in the case of planet earth.</p>
