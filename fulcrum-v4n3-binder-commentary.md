## Context

In the Q&A section of Fulcrum V4N3, editor Timothy Binder responds to reader questions about gravity drop tests conducted by Don Kelly. Binder uses the discussion to introduce Lloyd Zirbes' work to the Russell Science community, connecting Zirbes' experimental findings to Walter Russell's cosmogony. This is the editorial framing that accompanied the publication of Zirbes' "Old World Math — New World Math" and the Talmadge letter in the same issue.

## Binder's Commentary (pp. 569–571)

There are some additional observations that I will add to this discussion in the form of comments on an old Popular Science article that Toby Grotz gave me and two papers given me by Lloyd Zirbes some years ago that I feel pertain to the drop tests. Zirbes' papers are published as featured articles. Lloyd refolded a few years ago after spending his life energy attempting to bring in the new non-polluting technologies so necessary at this time to save our planet.

Popular Science June 1944 had an article titled "Magic with Magnetism" describing the work of Prof. Felix Ehrenhaft, the former director of the Physical Institute at the University of Vienna, who was then carrying on his work at the Zeiss optical company in New York City.

Prof. Ehrenhaft's work revealed that when two iron pole pieces were in acidulated water, they produced hydrogen gas through normally understood chemical reactions, but when the iron poles were magnetized they produced oxygen as well, and more of it at the north pole of the magnet than at the south pole. Science then, and maybe still now, does not recognize how this can happen. His explanation was that the magnetic lines of force were a current just as electricity is a current, and they separated the oxygen and hydrogen as electricity does it. He more or less made an equivalency of EM.

Professor Ehrenhaft's thinking is in agreement with and proves Russell's ideas in that both magnetic and electric fields to Russell are motion and both he called electric effects. The permanent magnets used in the experiments were found to lose magnetism much to the dismay of the manufacturers. Ehrenhaft decided this was because they were doing the work like electricity does of separating the water into its constituent parts: oxygen and hydrogen. When the magnetic current is switched on, the hydrogen bubbles that were rising from both pole pieces under ordinary chemical reaction change behavior; some stop in their tracks and reverse direction, going to the other pole and even downward. If copper particles are added to the water they rotate in the same plane as the hydrogen bubbles but in the opposite direction, and if the magnetic current is switched then the particles all switch directions too.

Also, if iron particles are in the air gap between the poles and in a homogeneous field, they will always go to either the north or south pole, and they will switch directions if the field is switched, thus proving that the magnetized particles have an excess or deficiency of north or south charge. He calls these particles magnetic ions. This is a demonstration of Russell's contention that there are no single charged particles, and that every magnet as well as every mass has some degree of dual charge or has polarity. In other words, the iron particles were not just north or south polarity but a predominance of one or the other and thus were compelled to go to the appropriate pole.

Prof. Ehrenhaft believed that a magnetic current had a rotating electric charge, which was demonstrated in the copper particles rotating opposite to the hydrogen bubbles, just as an electric current has a rotating magnetic charge. In essence, Ehrenhaft demonstrated Russell's contention that all particles are dual charged and that magnetic fields are accompanied by electric fields and vice versa. Russell simply called both electric and further said they both were Gravity effects.

**Lloyd Zirbes' articles bring other observations to Don Kelly's gravity drop tests that should make us question further the whole question of gravity and Galileo's law about the equivalent speed of falling objects.**

**Zirbes' tests reveal that different masses fall with different rates of speed even if they are not magnetically or electrically charged.** How can this be? Zirbes has an explanation in his article. Is it enough of an explanation?

By Russell's Cosmogony all elements are magnetically and electrically charged. When we add an electric charge to or magnetize a mass we are "pumping up" the atoms in the mass that are already charged to a now higher rate, but all masses are already charged electrically and magnetically. So, by Larry Tiegs' explanation we can see how differing masses will have differing "electric/magnetic wings" that will interact with the electric/magnetic vortex wings of this planet and thus differing drop times. And, further, as Don Kelly's tests have shown, if we pump up these masses with additional electric/magnetic fields we will increase the strength of the wings that exist around every mass and influence the drop time.

The interaction between the electric/magnetic (Gravity) wings of the mass and the electric/magnetic (Gravity) wings of the planet are what cause the significant difference in drop times, and there is some likely insignificant difference in the interaction of these wings with the surrounding air as well.

I believe the definitive answer to question three is that the observed effect is a consequence of motion in an accelerating mode rather than a decelerating mode. It has to be one or the other mode as any motion is one or the other.

**I encourage Don Kelly to investigate the drop times of different elements such as carbon and iron, as Lloyd Zirbes has demonstrated them to be different.** This puts another twist to the investigation.

## Newspaper Reproductions Published Alongside Zirbes' Articles

Fulcrum V4N3 also reproduced two newspaper articles alongside Zirbes' papers, with the editorial note: "These newspaper articles included to show different responses to Lloyd's letter to Boynton and Faller."

### 1. St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch, Saturday, December 12, 1986

**"Galileo revisited: Gravity studies suggest a sixth force of nature"**

Reports on Paul Boynton's measurements near a 2,000-foot TV tower suggesting the existence of a new fundamental force that adds a tiny boost to gravity's attraction. Boynton: "The finding is very exciting because it indicates the force we call gravity is much more complicated than we thought." Studies by Boynton and others found evidence for a fifth force which slightly counteracts gravity's pull over 10 to 1,000 yards.

### 2. Popular Science (referenced in editorial, date not specified)

Reports on James E. Faller of the National Bureau of Standards / JILA Boulder who repeated Galileo's Tower of Pisa experiment at much higher precision using vacuum chambers, stabilized laser, optical interferometry, and copper and uranium masses. The experiment confirmed identical acceleration due to gravity "with exquisite accuracy — better than five parts in ten to the tenth power."

Binder's editorial juxtaposition is significant: mainstream physics confirms Galileo with copper/uranium at short distance and high precision, while Zirbes reports dramatically different drop times for carbon/iron at 2,000 feet. The two results are not necessarily contradictory — the effect may be distance-dependent and/or composition-dependent in ways that short-distance high-precision tests cannot detect.

## Follow-up: Fulcrum V5N1, May 1997 (pp. 626–628)

In the Q&A section of the next issue, Larry Tiegs raises the G=mv² equation in the context of Russell cosmogony. Binder discusses it as compatible with Russell's framework — gravity as a function of mass times velocity squared, unifying gravitation with the two-way universe.

Binder writes that "Mr. Zirbes is to be congratulated as a thinker and truth seeker" for his accurate comments regarding the inadequacy of E=mc², while also noting "numerous errors in Mr. Zirbes' presentation" that serve as the premise for follow-up questions.

Binder poses an open question to readers: "Can Zirbes' equation be extended to express light, EM waves, sound, heat, and gravity as mathematically equivalent?"

## Significance

This editorial commentary is important for three reasons:

1. **Russell community endorsement:** Binder — editor of the only journal systematically applying Walter Russell's cosmogony to laboratory experiments — explicitly endorsed Zirbes' experimental findings and connected them to Russell's two-way gravity framework.

2. **Ehrenhaft bridge:** Binder introduced Felix Ehrenhaft's magnetic ion experiments (Vienna, 1940s) as independent confirmation of the same principle Zirbes demonstrated mechanically: all particles are dual-charged, and what appears as separate electric/magnetic forces are both aspects of what Russell called Gravity.

3. **Institutional context:** By publishing alongside the newspaper reproductions of Boynton's and Faller's work, Binder placed Zirbes' experiments in dialogue with mainstream fifth-force research — not as fringe outsider work, but as a parallel investigation into the same question.
