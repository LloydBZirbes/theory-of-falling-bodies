            <h2>NEW WORLD MATH</h2>

            <p>The equation which clearly and simply expresses the grand unification theory is G = mv<sup>2</sup>, where G = gravity, m = mass, and v = velocity. In this short essay we will attempt to offer a brief explanation of this equation in hopes that our readers will then apply it to given specific situations. You will quickly see its validity.</p>

            <p>In all of nature there exists but two forces: gravity and motion (velocity). Gravity is the force that causes motion, and motion in turn creates gravity. These two forces of nature are inextricably intertwined, yet they are also separate and distinct. Velocity pulls everything apart, causing expansion, while gravity pulls everything together, causing densification. Our universe is expanding, therefore, our universe is in the mode of acceleration. We say again - mass expands at the rate of velocity squared.</p>

            <p>To form a mind picture of gravity we could visualize an empty bubble â€“ a bubble which is an absolute vacuum. The size of that bubble is determined by two basic factors, namely, the size of the mass which produced it and the velocity of the bubble. Gravity, like mass, has a force value that increases or decreases at the rate of the distance squared, and there are also many other integral functions which we will not flirt with here. As has been stated before, gravity is of two parts. The Project Stardust team simply refers to these two parts as gravity A (attractive force) and gravity B (repulsive force).</p>

            <p>Gravity can be and is continuously being created. All falling bodies, from the smallest sub-atomic systems to the largest universal structures produce a repulsive force (see Theory of Falling Bodies I and II). The repulsive force (gravity B) is produced by particles of mass in the mode of direction change. The size of the bubble of gravity produced is directly proportional to the size of the particle and/or system that produced it. Two of the integral functions to consider are the velocity of the mass and the angle of directional change.</p>

            <p>To understand gravity A, the attractive force, we must understand that mass expands at the rate of velocity squared. For mass to accomplish expansion it must accept "space". That space is gravity, and therefore, as velocity forces mass to expand, gravity moves in to provide the needed space. This inward movement of gravity tends to push the mass back together, and this action is seen as an attraction.</p>

            <p>Placing mass into a universal equation is quite elementary, requiring only the elimination of the weight factor. Weight is nothing more than the inward push of gravity or the outward push of inertia. Because the weight value of a given quantity of mass varies from location to location (see essay Old World Math), it is a very arbitrary value. Indeed, weight is a factor only if you yourself are carrying it. To assign a consistent, workable value to a given volume of mass one must therefore concentrate on the density of that mass. Should weight ever be a consideration it must be seen in terms of gravity or inertia acting upon the mass. Mass itself must be considered in terms of the density value of a given volume. We have found that the density of any given volume of mass is inversely proportional to the velocity of the mass, ie., with an increase of velocity the mass density value will decrease.</p>

            <p>In this short writing we will not attempt to explore in any detail the correlation between temperature and the velocity of mass, but will instead simply state our findings. Mass in the mode of acceleration "absorbs" heat. This absorption results in the creation of a cooled area. Mass in the mode of deceleration releases heat. This release results in the creation of a warmed area. This heat is gravity, and so temperature can also be understood through the application of the unity equation. Though this is not a vital point in this paper, it certainly bears a mention.</p>

            <p>We have briefly examined gravity and mass and have determined that gravity equals mass at the rate of velocity squared. Now we must quickly explore the velocity factor, and hopefully all will then become clear.</p>

            <p>To visualize velocity we can picture in our mind an unending spiral staircase. The landing of this stairway represents zero velocity. At zero velocity complete densification of mass has occurred - there no longer exists any elements, for elements require space. Space is gravity, and gravity requires motion. At zero velocity there is no gravity, without which our entire solar system would fit into a quart jar - with room to spare. This quart jar would possess a weight value of zero, for weight depends upon gravity or inertia, which in turn rely on motion. Each step of the stairway will now represent an increase in velocity of one meter per second. Each increase in velocity will have a given effect on the mass involved, and as the analogy of the stairway implies, the effect is constant. Throughout any universe the effect of a given velocity on a given quantity of mass will always be constant. This constancy is the essence of a truly universal equation.</p>

            <p>All things in nature are progressive or regressive at the rate squared, and therefore, the amount of space (gravity) contained in a particle or system of particles is directly proportional to the rate of velocity squared. The same can be said of distance, ie., all forces decrease or increase their value at the rate of distance squared. As you consider what has been said it is our sincere hope that you understand the implication of the simple statement: mass expands at the rate of velocity squared. From this we deduce that as mass expands, space (gravity) is required, and that the amount of required space depends directly upon that velocity. Stated most simply:</p>
