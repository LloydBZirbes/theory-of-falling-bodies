## [MASS TO ENERGY CONVERSION](#mass-to-energy-conversion) {#mass-to-energy-conversion}
  
As a body obtains the velocity of light, the internal resistance becomes zero. Energy continues to be extracted from the body at an accelerated rate. The velocity of the body is equal to, or greater than the velocity of energy. This means energy cannot overtake (or "catch up with") and enter the body. The great pressure (potential) extracts all the energy from the body. The sub-atomic particles begin to "shed" their outermost shells (i.e., bubbles), and this process will continue until no particle remains. All that does remain is a vortex of pure (neutral) energy. The conversion of mass to energy is progressive at the rate of the velocity of light squared.  
  
### [DENSITY OF MASS](#density-of-mass) {#density-of-mass}
  
The density of a given element is directly related to the motion of that mass. A falling body is a transducer, the energy exchange of that transducer is limited by the internal resistance of that body. The value of that resistance is inversely proportional to the velocity of the body. Therefore, as the velocity of motion decreases, the internal resistance __increases__, and results in a zero value of energy flow. The body now becomes dormant and lies completely condensed - there exists no space, and no life. The force that will give this body life is motion. Should our entire solar system obtain a velocity of zero, it would probably fit into a quart jar.  
  
### [SUB-ATOMIC PARTICLES](#sub-atomic-particles) {#sub-atomic-particles}
  
Minute bubbles of energy, which we call neutral energy, are the building blocks of solid particles. As long as this energy (bubbles) remains at or above the velocity of light, the bubbles remain unattached and independent, however, when the leading edge begins to slow, the trailing bubbles begin to collide with the slowed bubbles. This causes the bubbles to pile up and compact, i.e., some bubbles encase other bubbles, as illustrated in figure 26.  
  

![a series of same-size circles are drawn from left to right. Near the left they are evenly spaced, not touching each other. Above them a label is shown: “above the speed of light”.
As the drawn circles progress toward the right the closer they are drawn to each other,. At some point they start touching each other. Then they start overlapping. Above these circles a label appears: “below the speed of light” .At the far right a fully  filled-in, black, circle is shown, with a label “RESULT: a solid particle”.](./img/fig26.jpg)

We therefore state that mass is but solidified energy. Sub-atomic particles vary greatly in size, but they are all created by nature in the same manner, and with the exception of size, weight, and configuration, they are __identical__. The scientific community speaks of different particles having different charges, but this is a mis-perception, or more precisely, a problem of mis-identification. There are very simple, logical reasons why that which is called an electron has a negative charge, while that which is called a proton has a positive charge, etc., but the explanation is beyond the scope of this paper, and will be discussed in depth in the segment dealing with atomic structure.
