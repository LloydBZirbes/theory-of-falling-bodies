There are various reasons for this failure, and lack of full knowledge of the actions of free falling bodies was the primary reason. He lacked accurate data - he lacked facts - he was doomed to fail. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>There is now such heavy reliance on the erroneous equation E = mc</span><span class="c1">2</span><span>&nbsp;by militarists in industry, politics, and science that questioning Einstein&#39;s very famous equation is viewed as an attack on their demi-god, and any &quot;offender&quot; is immediately attacked by those whose power and influence depends upon your continued </span><span class="c4">trust </span><span class="c0">in the promise of E = me. In reality, this promise is a lie, and anyone who has examined this equation knows it&#39;s in error. This presents an obvious question : if it is in error, then why do they cling to it? In our view it is like a root from which has grown a plant called science, technology and nuclear </span></p><p class="c2"><span>energy. This plant in turn feeds a beast known as the military/industrial complex. Were anyone to unearth this evil root called E = mc</span><span class="c1">2</span><span class="c0">, the plant would wither and the beast would starve. This is why no one dares question, and why the truth has remained hidden. To laymen we say - a lie quickly becomes complex, but the truth is clear and simple. WE will now examine this jealously guarded root in the light of truth, and let the reader decide where logic lies. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Einstein used ergs as his value for energy. An erg is a value taken from the centimeter-gram-second system of measurements. Please take note of the term gram, which indicates </span><span class="c4">weight</span><span>. An erg is defined as : a unit of energy or work equal to the </span><span class="c4">work </span><span class="c0">done by a force of one dyne acting over a distance of one centimeter. From the start we can clearly see the &quot;slippery&quot; terminology applied as an aid to confusing the issue (and safeguarding the root). Work, energy, and force are all equated. We ask, are they indeed all equal? It would appear they are if &quot;science&quot; needs them to be, but is this the truth? Let us continue working our way through this maze and see where it leads. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>One erg is a very small unit, so present day physicists use joules to place a value of E (energy). One joule was declared to equal ten million ergs, but the question then was, is a joule potential energy (voltage) or is it work done (ampere flow)? The congress decided the question declaring one joule to equal one watt of power. We now find that one watt is equivalent to an electrical flow of one amphere, and one ampere is the same as one coulomb. A coulomb is, by definition, the passing of one ampere of current across a given point in one second, and placed in concrete figures, a coulomb is a movement of 6.28 x 10</span><span class="c1">18</span><span>&nbsp;electrons. A single electron has an atomic mass unit value of 9.1095 x 10</span><span class="c1">-31</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">kilograms</span><span>. 9.1095 x 10</span><span class="c1">-31</span><span>&nbsp;kilograms times 6.28 x 10</span><span class="c1">18</span><span>&nbsp;electrons equals 5.708 x 10</span><span class="c1">-12</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;kilograms. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Science hopes you are completely confused by this time, but if we reduce this maze to a simple list, perhaps we will see more clearly. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">10 million ergs = 1 joule </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">1 joule &nbsp;= 1 watt </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&nbsp;1 watt &nbsp;= 1 amphere </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">1 amphere = 1 coulomb </span></p><p class="c5"><span>1 coulomb = 6.28 x 10</span><span class="c1">18</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;electrons </span></p><p class="c5"><span>6.28 x 10</span><span class="c1">18</span><span>&nbsp;electrons = 5.708 x 10</span><span class="c1">-12</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;KILOGRAMS </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>What was Einstein referring to when he spoke of energy? Weight? To have weight there must be mass, and so Einstein&#39;s &quot;E&quot; is really </span><span class="c4">mass</span><span class="c0">, is it not? </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>A quick glance at Einstein&#39;s m (mass) is all that&#39;s required to reveal the basic error. Once again we are dealing with kilograms as the unit of measurement. On the equator at the surface of earth, one gram of mass weighs one gram. That very same gram of mass in deep space will have a weight value of </span><span class="c4">zero</span><span class="c0">, while on the surface of Jupiter this gram of mass weighs 2.5 grams. In applying these values, we find that nuclear technology should not be functional in open space - yet it is. WE also find that on the surface of the planet Jupiter, a nuclear warhead should yield a 250% greater reaction - yet it won&#39;t. Clearly, reliance of the weight of m (mass) leads to gross errors in calculations, and errors in calculating lead to errors in judgement. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>We are told that in E = mc</span><span class="c1">2</span><span>. &nbsp;Einstein sought to express the equivalence of energy and mass, and Mr. Einstein was as correct as limited facts would allow him to be. Energy and_ mass are equivalent, for &quot;energy&quot; IS mass. It is then_ explained that c</span><span class="c1">2</span><span>&nbsp;comes into play only because of the &quot;traditional&quot; manner in which physicists calculate energy and mass. c</span><span class="c1">2</span><span>&nbsp;is, in fact, a value more or less pulled out of-thin air, with nothing to support it other than faulty calculations. Physicists know that it is equally correct to calculate on the basis of E = m, and to adjust the units of measurement to suit the situation. That this fact is avoided in favor of the astronomical figure represented by c</span><span class="c1">2</span><span>&nbsp;(i.e.., 8.9874</span><span class="c1">16</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;meters per second) should alert us to the fraud involved. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Even though the </span><span class="c4">most </span><span>vigorous nuclear reaction yield at most 1% of the promised energy, science holds onto the &quot;carrot&quot; of c</span><span class="c1">2</span><span>&nbsp;as the </span><span class="c4">promise </span><span class="c0">of the future. In truth, if one were to be really precise, this mere 1% could be dissected into the various &quot;quasi&quot; concepts currently lumped under the heading &quot;energy&quot;, and the lie would become even more apparent. Science has not only broken their promise - they have broken faith with the people. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>In summation we should briefly address a question often put to us: if these technologies (electron/nuclear based) are wrong, then why do they function? The answer lies in the work of Maxwell, Faraday, and the other classical, true scientists, who performed hands-on experimentation to determine what </span><span class="c4">worked</span><span>. Modern theoretical scientists took this work and attempted to build a theory which would explain </span><span class="c4">why </span><span class="c0">things worked. When the militarists found a theory which worked to their advantage, progress in this area was halted, and it remains stagnant to this day. Data which does not fit the theory is simply ignored, and dissident researchers silenced. Those who attack our findings due to ignorance or fear of losing their power and influence must be reminded that Mr. Einstein, the guru of the atomic age, died trying to formulate unity. If he&#39;s been satisfied with his original theory, then what was he looking for? </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_____________________________________</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">NEW WORLD MATH </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>The equation which clearly and simply expresses the grand unification theory is G = mv</span><span class="c1">2</span><span class="c0">, where G = gravity, m = mass, and v = velocity. In this short essay we will attempt to offer a brief explanation of this equation in hopes that our readers will then apply it to given specific situations. You will quickly see its validity. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In all of nature there exists but two forces: gravity and motion (velocity). Gravity is the force that causes motion, and motion in turn creates gravity. These two forces of nature are inextricably intertwined, yet they are also separate and distinct. Velocity pulls everything apart, causing expansion, while gravity pulls everything together, causing densification. Our universe is expanding, therefore, our universe is in the mode of acceleration. We say again - mass expands at the rate of velocity squared. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">To form a mind picture of gravity we could visualize an empty bubble - a bubble which is an absolute vacuum. The size of that bubble is determined by two basic factors, namely, the size of the mass which produced it and the velocity of the bubble. Gravity, like mass, has a force value that increases or decreases at the rate of the distance squared, and there are also many other integral functions which we will not flirt with here. As has been stated before, gravity is of two parts. The Project Stardust team simply refers to these two parts as gravity A (attractive force) and gravity B (repulsive force). </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Gravity can be and is continuously being created. All falling bodies, from the smallest sub-atomic systems to the largest universal structures produce a repulsive force (see Theory of Falling Bodies I and II). The repulsive force (gravity B) is produced by particles of mass in the mode of direction change. The size of the bubble of gravity produced is directly proportional to the size of the particle and / or system that produces it. Two of the integral functions to consider are the velocity of the mass and the angle of directional change. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">To understand gravity A, the attractive force, we must understand that Mass expands at the rate of velocity squared. For mass to accomplish expansion it must accept &quot;space&quot;. That space is gravity, and therefore, as velocity forces mass to expand, gravity moves in to provide the needed space. This inward movement of gravity tends to push the mass back together, and this action is seen as an attraction. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Placing mass into a universal equation is quite elementary, requiring only the elimination of the weight factor. Weight is nothing more than the inward push of gravity or the outward push of inertia. Because the weight value of a given quantity of mass varies from location to location (see essay Old World Math), it is a very arbitrary value. Indeed, weight is a factor only if you yourself are carrying it. To assign a consistent, workable value to a given volume of mass one must therefore concentrate on the density of that mass. Should weight ever be a consideration it must be seen in terms of gravity or inertia acting upon the mass. Mass itself must be considered in terms of the density of any given volume of mass in inversely proportional to the velocity of the mass, i.e., with an increase of velocity the mass density value will decrease. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In this short writing we will not attempt to explore in any detail the correlation between temperature and the velocity of mass, but will instead simply state our findings. Mass in the mode of acceleration &quot;absorbs&quot; heat. This absorption results in the creation of a cooled area. Mass in the mode of deceleration releases heat. This release results in the creation of a warmed area. This heat is gravity, and so temperature can also be understood through the application of the unity equation. Though this is not a vital point in this paper, it certainly bears a mention. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We have briefly examined gravity and mass and have determined that gravity equals mass at the rate of velocity squared. Now we must quickly explore the velocity factor, and hopefully all will then become clear. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">To visualize velocity we can picture in our mind an unending spiral staircase. The landing of this stairway represents zero velocity. At zero velocity complete densification of mass has occurred - there no longer exists any elements, for elements require space. Space is gravity, and gravity requires motion. At zero velocity there is no gravity, without which our entire solar system would fit into a quart jar - with room to spare. This quart jar would possess a weight value of zero, for weight depends upon gravity and inertia, which in turn rely on motion. Each step of the stairway will now represent an increase in velocity of one meter per second. Each increase in velocity will have a given effect on the mass involved, and as the analogy of the stairway implies, the effect is constant. Throughout any universe the effect of a given velocity on a given quantity of mass will always be constant. This constancy is the essence of a truly universal equation. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>All things in nature are progressive or regressive at the rate squared, and therefore, the amount of space (gravity) contained in a particle or system or particles is directly proportional to the rate of velocity squared. The same can be said of distance, i.e., all forces decrease or increase their value at the rate of distance squared. As you consider what has been said it is our sincere hope that you understand the implication of the simple statement: mass expands at the rate of velocity squared. From this we deduce that as mass expands, space (gravity) is required, and that the amount of required space depends directly upon that velocity. Stated most simply: G = mv</span><span class="c1">2</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zirbes Enterprises, Project Stardust Team, July 1988 </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Reproduction and distribution of this material is approved and encouraged</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
