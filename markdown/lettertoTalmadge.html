Lafayette, Ind. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dear Mr. Talmadge, </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I have become aware that you&#39;ve taken an interest in searching for a repulsive force in nature which &quot;counteracts&quot; gravity, and I am writing to offer a suggestion as to how you can gain immediate proof that such a force does indeed exist. Since you are in effect at square one in your search, I will recommend you begin with a simple and straightforward test first conducted by myself and an associate in the early 1960s which I guarantee yields a dramatic result and offers irrefutable proof that Galileo&#39;s work was incomplete at best. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">For this particular test I suggest using a ten pound sphere of carbon and a ten pound sphere of iron. The circumference of the carbon sphere will of course be greater than that of the iron, but this factor is very important to the result of the test, as you will soon see. You will also need to construct a drop box large enough to accommodate the two spheres and to incorporate some sort of a triggering mechanism which will ensure the spheres are released simultaneously. To acquire the absolute proof you are looking for, the distance of the drop should be at least 2,000 feet. We used an open mine shaft in Northern Minnesota, and that site worked out very well. After taking into account air flows, lunar winds, etc., make your drop. In our tests we had set up a high speed camera near the impact plane to record the results, but if you have an extra person at hand to make a visual observation the camera wouldn&#39;t be absolutely necessary - the result is so pronounced that it cannot be missed. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You will find that even after all possible interfering factors are accounted for, the carbon sphere will impact after a 2,000 foot fall long before the iron sphere strikes the impact plane. We found this particular test to be of great value because it eliminated the possibility that air resistance was the major factor in discrepancies we&#39;d found between rates of acceleration of different elements in some of the other </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">tests we had conducted. Our result showed that the iron sphere was still six feet from the impact plane at the instant the carbon sphere impacted, proving that different elements falling in a gravitational field accelerated at different rates. The striking, unmistakable result yielded by this test qualifies it as an excellent starting point, and I recommend it highly for the reason that it quickly establishes a solid working foundation from which to proceed. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I realize that you may not have the facilities at hand to allow you to easily arrange to run this test, and so as you will notice I have sent an identical letter to some of your fellow researchers who are also now looking for the repulsive force. It is my great hope that if it is beyond your present means to run this simple test, then perhaps it will be within someone else&#39;s means. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After more that twenty-five years of talking about a repulsive force, it is gratifying for me to see persons such as yourself exploring this avenue of research, and I congratulate you. Should you continue this quest into the actions of and reasons for the repulsive force, it will ultimately lead you to unity of all things, and many new technologies vital to the survival of this planet in her time of crisis. If I can be of any assistance to you in suggesting further tests, sharing the results to the numerous tests I&#39;ve conducted, or in answering any questions you may have, I will be happy to oblige. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">cc: </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">R.
