            <h2>Theory of Falling Bodies II</h2>

            <p>As a body begins to fall a centrifugal force is applied to the body and is "felt" in the opposite direction of the fall (figure 43).</p>

            <img src="../img/fig43.jpg" alt="Arrow pointing DOWN on Right, labelled: 'Direction of fall:' A large sphere is shown with three arrows inside it, pointing up towards 11, 12 and 1 O'clock. They are labelled: 'Centrifugal Force'." />
            <p class="figure-caption">Fig. 43</p>

            <p>This centrifugal force results in mass being "compressed" at the upper portion of the body ie., in the opposite direction of the fall (figure 44).</p>

            <img src="../img/fig44.jpg" alt="Arrow pointing DOWN on Right, labelled: 'Direction of fall:' A large sphere is shown with three arrows inside it, pointing up towards 11, 12 and 1 O'clock. At the top part of the sphere thin, short lines are drawn inside the sphere, similar to minute lines on a watch dial. They are labelled: 'Area of compressed mass'" />
            <p class="figure-caption">Fig. 44</p>

            <p>This area of compressed mass results in an area of greater density. To obtain greater density of any mass, the "space" within the atoms which comprise that mass must decrease, and therefore, the atoms within the compressed area of the body begin to "shed" that space (figure 45).</p>

            <img src="../img/fig45.jpg" alt="Same as fig 44, with the addition of many small spheres drawn near the top of the sphere as though they are escaping the main larger sphere. They are labelled: 'Bubbles of space, extracted (neutral) energy, or that which is better known as gravity is expelled from the compressed area of the falling body.'" />
            <p class="figure-caption">Fig. 45</p>

            <p>The compressed area, due to centrifugal force, results in an area of densified mass. This increased density results from the expulsion/extraction of the space (i.e.: gravity) contained within the atoms of that mass prior to the onset of the fall. The extracted energy from the upper portion of the body may be seen as the male factor in that its area has a higher concentration of gravity, and therefore a greater gravitational value than surrounding areas. The female area of the body, due to the motion of the body, is an area of lesser concentration of mass, causing this mass to seek to expand. The mass in the female area of the body requires "space" to accomplish an expansion of the atoms which comprise the mass (figure 46).</p>

            <img src="../img/fig46.jpg" alt="Same as in Fig 45, except now at the bottom of the large sphere is added short arrows inside it. They originate at the 7, 6, 5, 4 O'Clock location and point to the bottom of the larger arrows that are pointing to the top of the sphere. These smaller arrows are labelled: 'Expanded area of mass resulting in a gravity vacuum or female area.'" />
            <p class="figure-caption">Fig. 46</p>

            <p>The male area of the body has a higher than normal density of mass and is surrounded by greater value of gravity than is the female area. Nature will always seek balance, and in the case of a falling body, this primary directive of nature is manifested by the female area "feeling" the greater gravitational value of the male area and moving toward it. This action results in the rotation or "spin" of the body.</p>

            <p>During those early stages of a body's fall, its velocity is continually increasing, and the greater the velocity of the falling body the greater the rotation rate or spin value of that body. Due to this rotation/spin, the previously discussed centrifugal force is now being distributed around the entire body at the leading edge of the fall, or equator of the body. Centrifugal force causes mass to densify along this equator and to therefore expel space (i.e.: gravity). As the value of the rotation/spin increases in value, neutral energy (better known as gravity) is expelled or extracted along the entire equator of the body (i.e.: the leading edge of the fall) in ever increasing amounts (figure 47).</p>

            <img src="../img/fig47.jpg" alt="A large sphere. An arrow on the right of the sphere is pointing DOWN, labelled: 'Direction of fall'. The sphere has a vertical line going up through the centre. The line is made up of several short arrows that have small bubbles on them. At intervals the arrows split to: vertically up, about 45 degr left and 45 degr right. Near the top of the vertical line of arrows it says: 'Centrifugal force due to the rotation of the body'. Below the sphere is another arrow labelling the small arrows. The small arrows with the bubbles arch over the sphere at the top and arch underneath toward, from our viewpoint, the front of the sphere. A label at the bottom says: 'Expelled space due to the compression of mass'" />
            <p class="figure-caption">Fig. 47</p>

            <p>We will now turn the body ninety degrees and observe a cutÂ­away view (figure 48).</p>

            <img src="../img/fig48.jpg" alt="A large sphere. An arrow on the right of the sphere is pointing DOWN, labelled: 'Direction of fall'. With the sphere is a smaller one about half the size. In the centre of the spheres it says: 'Area of expanded mass - the female factor.' From the smaller sphere to the inner edge of the larger sphere are arrows at every two hours, approx. Escaping from the outer sphere are long curved lines with bubble of them. Their curves are clockwise. The bubbles on these lines are labelled 'Extracted or expelled energy (gravity) at the leading edge of the fall.' Small arrows point toward the outer edge of the larger sphere from the far right: 'Densified mass due to the centrifugal force - the male factor.'" />
            <p class="figure-caption">Fig. 48</p>

            <p>Upon exiting the body the extracted energy moves or "flows" in a direction that lies parallel to the body. This results in the "bubbles of nothing" called gravity orbiting the falling body, and due to the continued motion of the body, each orbit completed by a given "bubble" is slightly larger than its previous orbit (figure 49).</p>

            <img src="../img/fig49.jpg" alt="A circle is drawn in a solid line. It is called 'Falling body'. An arrow on the right of the diagram is pointing DOWN, labelled: 'Direction of fall'. It has a long line expanding in orbit, round and round, drawn in dotted line. In the centre of the circle is a smaller circle. On its top it says: 'Axle of rotation'" />
