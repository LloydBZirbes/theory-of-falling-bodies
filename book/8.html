            <h2>CONSEQUENCES OF NUCLEAR ENERGY</h2>

            <p>As explained earlier, the energies generated by a body in motion are extracted in the form of bubbles of energy which are neutral in respect to the other bubbles extracted from the same body, however, the size of the bubbles are directly proportional to the size of the body from which they've been extracted. This means that larger bodies produce larger bubbles, and so we can place values on these bubbles and say that some bubbles are negative in respect to bubbles produced by other bodies, ie., they are smaller. By the same method we can say that some bubbles are positive in respect to bubbles produced by other bodies, ie., they are larger. This terminology is very important for the reader to understand, so that the information you've received will be easily understood. It is vital that the people who read these pages come to see the larger picture. It's not just the ionosphere that's in danger ­it is all of the combined systems of the earth altering their normally balanced cycles. The entire planet earth is at risk in this crisis, so it's imperative that the reader comprehends the way in which the various systems interweave and how they are therefore all out of balance, and it will take a major effort to put these cycles back into a proper balance. Once the processes are understood, the true magnitude of the problem becomes apparent.</p>

            <p>During the process of fission, a neutron is hurled at the nucleus of a uranium (or plutonium) atom and it divides that mass. In this process neutrons and protons are destroyed and their energies released. After studying falling bodies and atomic structure it should be apparent that these enormous amounts of energy released in fission are the result of the many systems of particles within the neutron or proton being forced out of their orbits and turned loose into the environment in a highly unstable state. Also, it should be clear that many of these systems are completely destroyed, leaving only highly energetic, very minute particles moving at incredible velocities. These particles and very minute, unstable systems move off in all directions ­ some to pass through water to create steam, some down into the core of the earth, and some straight through the walls of the containment vessels and into the atmosphere.</p>

            <p>In each and every fission reaction, approximately twenty protons and neutrons are shattered, the exact number depends upon the type of material being used. The average proton or neutron contains approximately twenty-two thousand particles, so do some math and you'll quickly see how many trillions of these unstable particles and systems are being forcefully introduced into our ecosystem per micro­second, worldwide.</p>

            <p>We earlier carefully explained that any unstable system will immediately attempt to balance itself, and for many of these newly destabilized particles and systems this attempt begins as they pass through the walls of the containment vessels. Here again the jipsee systems are a major factor, for as these minute particles and systems of particles stream through the walls they are already in the process of re­assimilation into larger, more balanced systems. While engaged in this process, the jipsee systems in the atoms which form the containment vessel walls are very strongly attracted to these highly unstable systems, and often leave their orbits to assemble and attempt to balance these very unstable systems and particles. This means that from the moment a nuclear plant begins operations, the walls of the containment vessels begin to weaken so that as time passes they also become unstable and allow ever larger and larger systems and particles to escape unopposed.</p>

            <p>To briefly address the question of where these particles and systems go once beyond the containment walls, we would begin by considering those which travel inward ­ towards the core of the earth. In the segment on falling bodies we discussed the cycle of energy exchange experienced by a body in motion, and stated that under normal conditions the rate of extraction is balanced with the rate of energy input (at the poles) and that this cycle is tied directly to the velocity and rotational rate of the body. If the reader understands this cycle, they will also be able to clearly see that as these particles move into the core, they are disrupting this normally balanced cycle. More input energy, no matter the source of input, forces the planet to generate more extracted energy to attempt to compensate. The rate of the extraction directly affects the rate of the rotation, so as the energy extraction becomes progressively accelerated, the rotation rate will follow suit. As the cycle completes Itself and the extra energy extracted now returns as input energy (approx. 10­12 years), this extra level of input, combined with the continuous additional input energy from nuclear fission ensures that the problem will continue to be progressive.</p>

            <p>We estimate that 15% of the extra energy forced into the cycle by the use of nuclear fission remains in a state which is negative in respect to the normal energy output of this planet, and though this percent of negativity has its undesirable effects, it is the Increased rate of energy exchange which most concerns us now. As should be apparent to the reader at this point, an increased rate of energy exchange and rate of rotation will cause an increase in the repulsive force exerted by the falling body. As the repulsive force increases the body moves farther away from its nucleus, which in our case is the sun. If the orbit of this planet expands, it cannot help but affect the orbits of the other planets in the system, particularly our closest neighbors.</p>

            <p>Of the many highly energetic particles and systems released through fission, many travel toward the moon, and because the moon and its extracted energy are very negative in respect to planet earth, some of these energetic, still unstable particles and systems are readily accepted by the moon as input energy. This will increase the cycle of energy exchange in the moon, once again resulting in a greater repulsive force generated by that body. Clearly, the moon cannot fail to move farther away from the earth. The tides, (which are erroneously said to be caused by the gravity of the moon "pulling" at earth) are becoming ever more severe, but this is only the beginning. As the repulsive forces of earth and moon continue to increase, the Interaction between them (which is the true reason for earth tides) will cause the tidal cycles to become increasingly dangerous to coastal dwellers. This new balance of interactions between the respective fields of earth and moon will also increase the degree of earth wobble, but the position and field of the sun is also a major factor in this equation, and so will be considered after solar structure has been fully addressed.</p>
