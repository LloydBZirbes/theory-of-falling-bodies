            <h2>The Van Allen Radiation Belt</h2>

            <p>Until the first nuclear war in the mid 1940's, the radiation belt surrounding earth functioned perfectly - as just described. For the next decade bomb testing continued, as man played with his new toy - fission. When Dr. Van Allen undertook to measure the radiation belt, he discovered there were two belts surrounding earth, and made public his findings. Murmurings among the technicians involved with the project caused concerns that the lower belt may be the result of nuclear fission debris.</p>

            <p>Perhaps to still rising doubts about nuclear fission and fusion, a project code named Argus was carried out in Aug.-Sept. 1958, where three hydrogen bombs were exploded in space beneath the lower area of the Van Allen belts. The project itself was top secret, but its effects were not. The fused material produced by these explosions was of course very heavy as compared with other fission produced material within the belt, and so it settled in at a lower layer of the magnetic field which had previously been void of debris. Being so near earth and very heavy, this fusion debris was very rapidly channeled back into earth as input. Atmospheric scientists who knew nothing of Argus detected great streaks of lithium in the especially brilliant aurora borealis which occurred on the heels of Argus. Puzzled and fearful, these scientists quickly announced that there was severe fusion occurring in the radiation belt. News of Argus did not come to light until some years later, and is still shrouded in some mystery. Two of the most obvious questions which remain to be answered are, why did they do it, and so they yet realize how very close they may have come to fusing the entire radiation belt and setting off a reaction which could have fused the oceans of earth?</p>

            <p>In 1962, the scientists involved with the space and nuclear programs again measured the radiation "belts", but now found there was only one huge belt, some 35,000 miles thick. It was loudly proclaimed that Van Allen had been incorrect in his measurements, and that he'd mistaken the one large belt for two separate belts. Van Allen was correct. At the time he took his readings there were two belts - one natural and one (the lower) unnatural - full of fission debris. By 1962 the large area between those two belts had been filled in by the vast amounts of fissioned material produced on earth, which then spread out around earth â€“ each different particle finding a niche (layer) within the magnetic field suitable to its particular weight and/or stage of assimilation. The very lowest layers were now also filled in, but these contained fused material created through hydrogen bomb testing. These are very heavy (and close to earth) being more fully assimilated, and contain more complex systems - including basic elements and some simple compounds. Figures two-five attempt to show the stages in the deliberate and ongoing destruction of earth's protective shield, the radiation belt.</p>

            <!-- Note: Figures two-five are mentioned but not provided in the text. If you have these figures, they can be inserted here. -->

            <p>When measurements were taken again in 1962 it was found that there now existed only one huge belt, for by this time ongoing fission programs on earth had added vast quantities of new fission debris to the radiation belt, and the space between the natural and fission belts was beginning to fill in.</p>

            <p>Today, thanks to the efforts of university teams and other research facilities, the presence of nuclear debris at least in the lower belt is grudgingly admitted by our nation's "responsible" agencies to be the result of the nuclear programs, but concerns for this fact, if any exists, are brushed aside with the old "catch all" argument that nuclear energy is a natural energy. This argument continues on to assure any citizens who are aware enough to be concerned that since fission and fusion are nature's favorite tools, that nature also has built-in mechanisms for balancing out little problems like debris in radiation belts. We fully agree that nature will restore balance, but it will not be in the quiet manner our very learned leaders expect. Nature is about to begin making a great deal of noise, and this brings us to the subject of how restoration of balance will be achieved.</p>

            <h3>NOTE:</h3>
            
            <p>To facilitate this discussion, the overlapping sections of the radiation belt (fig. 5) will be spoken of as though they were three distinct belts.</p>

            <p>All three sections of the radiation belt (natural, fission, and fusion) contribute constant input to the pole areas. Earth has no mechanisms for regulating the flow, relying completely on a balanced system (and balanced input), so when the system is not balanced, earth must continue to accept all offerings. Due to the existence and constant input of the unnatural belts the corridors leading to the poles are highly congested (as are the belts themselves) and velocities are reduced. Lesser velocity and more collisions allow many of the protons and neutrons from the natural and fission belts to begin assimilation into more complex systems even before their arrival in the corridor. This additional weight coupled with a further reduction in velocity upon entering the tightly packed corridor prevent many of these systems from converting to energy. Instead, they will collide with similar (highly isotopic) systems in the corridor and continue assimilation with these systems. Many are still incomplete when they reach the earth's atmosphere, but others have managed to assimilate into simple elements, notably forms of hydrogen. These elements are formed under unnatural, extreme conditions, and investigation would reveal that super heavy, abnormal forms of hydrogen are entering earth's atmosphere from these corridors in a steady stream.</p>
