            <h2>SOLAR RESEARCH</h2>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>

            <p>In the mid 1970's an in-depth study of our solar system's nucleus, the sun, was initiated by the Stardust Team which has led to many startling discoveries. The experimental methods employed included collecting photographs, drawings, and detailed data from many observatories and research stations around the world, building models based on the data, and making countless calculations. Working to make sense of seeming contradictions exhibited by the sun, our team focused on its many well documented but unexplained behaviors and characteristics, a few of which are listed below, and gradually a clear picture began to emerge.</p>

            <h3>Major Solar "Mysteries":</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>The solar surface appears "grainy"</li>
                <li>The sun emits many different frequencies</li>
                <li>Solar storms vary in both size and field strength</li>
                <li>Solar flares are relatively common occurrences</li>
                <li>Solar storms often move over the surface of the sun with no regard for the direction of the sun's rotation</li>
                <li>Solar prominences occur in which trillions of tons of mass temporarily escape from the main body of the sun and relocate elsewhere</li>
                <li>The solar surface contains many crevasses and valleys which appear, remain for a length of time, and then disappear</li>
                <li>The sun shines and is hot, and the earth shines and experiences warmth from the sun, yet space is cold and dark</li>
            </ol>

            <p>If the reader has ever tried to follow the reasoning of current scientific thought on these and other questions, then two things should be clear, namely, the scientific community as a whole is convinced that our sun is in effect a huge nuclear reactor, and that because of this conviction their subsequent theories are speculative and/or contradictory and confused. If the reader were to take the time to delve into current theory on questions relating to solar activity, it would quickly become apparent that no theory is too contradictory to be given loud applause and wide circulation, if only said theory does not in any way conflict with the idea that the sun is a nuclear reactor.</p>

            <p>After completing our study of falling bodies in general, we fully realized that modern science was not infallible, so in solar research we relied only on direct evidence, and ignored all previous theories. Masses of accumulated information were sorted and classified, then based on this data various solar models were constructed and analyzed. Clearly, there were two possible explanations for the existence of multiple and changing magnetic fields on the sun. One would be if through the use of broad assumptions and "open parameters" we were to make the sun into a unique phenomenon, capable of producing these many fields even though it was a single body (as current theory maintains). The other possible explanation was that the sun was not a single body at all. Since it's a well demonstrated fact that in nature a single body cannot produce many-poled fields, and because we had denied ourselves the use of arbitrary assumptions, our team agreed to consider the possibility that the sun was multi-bodied, and we constructed our models accordingly. Mathematical calculations were made based on what we then knew about the dynamics of falling bodies from previous research, and year by year the­ mysteries began to solve themselves.</p>

            <h3>SOLAR STRUCTURE</h3>

            <p>Deep within our nucleus, the sun, reside many huge bodies which are roughly the size of the planet Jupiter. Each has its own rotation rate and builds a field of extracted energy about itself as does any falling body. The repulsive action of this field of energy guarantees space between the bodies. Calculations show there are approximately two thousand of these massive bodies, all rotating at a rate determined by their specific mass. Though there is this variation in their individual rotation rates due to differing mass factors, these huge bodies are all orbiting the center of gravity at roughly the same rate, and due to their close proximity to the center of gravity they together complete an orbit of this gravitational center approximately every forty eight hours. These massive bodies, individually and as a unit, are in motion at an extremely high velocity.</p>

            <p>On the outer shell of the sun reside thousands of smaller, earth sized bodies, which also have an individual rotation rate determined by their specific mass. Each of these obey the laws of falling bodies, and so build an individual field of extracted energy about themselves which repulses the fields of all other falling bodies, thus ensuring space between them. These bodies also orbit the gravitational center of the sun at a constant velocity, but due to their greater distance from the center they complete an orbit only every thirty­two days.</p>

            <p>The area between the major bodies (interior near the gravitational center) and the minor bodies (outer crust) is filled with many thousands of bodies which range in size between these two extremes. To visualize this arrangement imagine many thousands of different sized bodies within a given sphere, where the largest bodies are in the center, and the rest of the bodies become progressively smaller the nearer their proximity to the outer crust. A highly simplified cross section of the sun illustrates this below.</p>

            <img src="../img/fig33.jpg" alt="Diagram is labelled on the right: 'minor bodies create the grainy appearance of the solar surface'. Another label on the left side says: 'Cross section of the sun showing body position and rotation'. Diagram shows a centre circle, with 6 concentric rings around it, each ring is made up of circles. The centre circle is the largest. Immediately around that circle is the first ring of circles, they are slightly smaller in size than the centre circle. All circles bear arrows showing counter-clockwise motion. The next concentric circle is made up of circles of a smaller diameter. The next concentric circle is again made up of circles of a smaller diameter still And so on, until we reach the outer concentric ring of circles which are made up of almost specks, but we see arrows marking their counter-clockwise motion." />
            <p class="figure-caption">Fig. 33</p>

            <p>We've explained that the major bodies are in close proximity to the center of gravity and complete an orbit of this center approximately every forty eight hours, and that the minor bodies at a greater distance complete the same orbit of the center every thirty­two days. All of the intermediate bodies residing between these two extremes also orbit the same center, but at varying rates determined by their mass and subsequent position within the body of the sun. The larger of these intermediate bodies will be found closer to the major bodies nearer the center, and their rotation rate approaches that of the major bodies. Also, being relatively close to the center of gravity of the sun allows them to complete an orbit of that center in a relatively short period of time. The smaller intermediate bodies will have a slower rotation rate, and because they reside closer to the surface of the sun and farther from the center of gravity, the time it takes for one of these bodies to complete an orbit of the center is more than for larger bodies. This concept of varying orbital rates is roughly illustrated in the cross section below.</p>

            <img src="../img/fig34.jpg" alt="Same as Fig 33, with these additions: On the right a label explains: 'Vector A = 32 days; Vector B = 15 days; Vector C = 7 days; Vector D = 24 hours'. On the left a label says: 'Cross section of the sun showing orbit rates.' The concentric rings each have a letter, and an arrows pointing counter-clockwise, indicating that each concentric (made of the circles) collectively flow counter-clockwise. The outermost ring is labelled 'A'. The next one in, 'B'. etc. 'D' is the ring that is closest to the centre circle." />
