So modern physics, of course, says that that's impossible.
That's right. Absolutely impossible.
And then if you could actually produce a gravity generator,
then you've destroyed the foundation against it,
improving it with existing physics.
I already destroyed that in 1961 with my test of falling bodies.
The scientific community will not accept them.
Now you have sent this material all over the scientific community in America, correct?
It's far more than America.
When I first started mailing in 1961,
it went to the major universities,
and then I continued the mailings to all governmental bodies.
Then I continued to one mailing with extensive information
was sent to every major university in the United States,
every state university in the United States.
Since then, the information has been moved into Russia, China,
Australia, New Zealand, England, all through Europe.
It's very widespread.
And yet it has not been recognized yet. Why is this?
Nobody wants to make a test on falling bodies.
A very simple test.
Could it also be that if this was proved to be true,
that Galileo was wrong and modern physics is based on a mistake, in essence,
that they would know then that the nuclear reactors are actually putting out
millions of tons of these particles per day,
and that all nuclear reactors would have to be closed immediately?
Immediately, yeah.
So there are other factors involved here,
which is probably why this information has not become common knowledge.
There is no question about that.
There is complete opposition from the military industrial complex.
Complete opposition.
And yet, at the present course, there will be no animal or plant life left within ten years
if this knowledge is not utilized.
That's correct.
So, and all of the Greenpeace's and all the wonderful organizations or Sierra clubs
or whatever you consider an environmental oriented group,
all of these organizations will be absolutely ineffective
in accomplishing ultimately any of their goals unless this knowledge is utilized.
Is that correct?
That's correct.
Are there any other people in this country that you won't know of
that fully understand this body of knowledge?
No.
Well, I know for a fact that simply because I have not released technology,
I have said, you know, "This is a test on falling bodies.
And so obviously, by using your own mathematics, take a look at Newton, take a look at Albert Einstein,
and thusly you will clearly see this or that."
I will more or less put it like that.
But I have not released technology
and I will not release any technology until a group of people come together,
and sit down, and say, "Let's take a look at it."
And this has got to be a trusted group,
and then we will go from there. Until then, I'm not going to release any technology.
Now you say in your literature that you can actually put forth a barrier of attractive gravity
which will screen undesirable particles from the atmosphere and magnetic field of the earth,
and that this can be used to normalize the ozone and magnetic fields of the earth.
True.
True.
So with your technology you have a total solution,
and you have sent this information around the country,
and yet no one has really listened.
No.
No one has listened.
Not at all.
Now remember I did not release the technology as how to do it,
and simply what it would do.
You have developed a generator that is 300% efficient,
one megawatt turns the generator and produces three megawatts power.
This is true, yes.
Now modern physicists are again going to come up and say a perpetual motion,
perpetual motion.
No way impossible.
Yes, it breaks the laws of energy conservation.
And of course many people have proved that the laws of energy conservation are incorrect.
There are people right now in California, Dr. Bruce DePalma,
has clearly proved it.
Joe Newman has proved it.
Along with a hundred other people, have proved that the energy conservation laws are incorrect,
as I also have proved it.
Now they have proved that, but they have not developed this other technology.
Oh no.
No, no.
You see, these people are still functioning on the basic laws of physics,
and until they back off and take a look at existing laws of physics,
and take a look at -- or do their own test on falling bodies --
there, there's no way they're gonna get over this hump they're on.
Now you have also said in your material that you have produced technology,
the injection of contained gravity into any matter or mass,
which will gently expand the mass,
and allow one to rearrange the atomic structure to produce any element that may be desired.
This is true.
Unlimited quantities of gold or anything?
Well, I sort of felt that when it gets on the way,
we should build a street of gold simply out of the arrogance, you know,
showing arrogance to the existing establishment.
Now if you can actually make this gold,
then why haven't you already made it and funded it yourself?
I don't have the funds to make it.
So you build a gravity generator, where is it now?
The gravity generator on the shop was destroyed by fire.
By fire?
When I took this test, I fractured vertebrae in my back, something struck me,
and an ambulance took me to the hospital.
I say six weeks, but really, eight weeks.
And in my absence, the shop was burned down,
and all my equipment, everything burnt.
When it was checked out, they found that chemicals were used in this fire.
So it is not just, you know, the guy down in the street to burn it down,
it's some professional, and there really is no valid reason
why a professional would go through all of that effort.
You know, the value just wasn't there.
And so I have my thoughts that there was a force unbeknown to me such as
to put out some group functioning within the so-called secret government of the U.S.
The secret government?
That could be something akin to the parallel government
that has been working with our country and doing things like Iran-Contra.
True, true. This is exactly what I am referring to.
Now, these people want to, so far, or someone has been stopping you
and anyone else who has tried to put forth these technologies,
but yet you have showed that if they are not utilized,
there will be no animal or plant life left.
True.
Is there any way do you think that these forces will ever come to agree
or are they absolutely committed towards absolute control?
Well, they're committed to absolute control,
and they're going to keep that control if it kills everybody in the process.
Well, then how can you possibly accomplish your goals?
By reaching out to people. Just plain people.
Just plain people. I'm putting together a group and saying,
let's do it. Now, once we do it, then here it is.
They no longer can tell the public, no, it don't work because here it is, it does work.
And I'm thinking of the gravity generator, you know,
let's folks fly a craft around the country at a very great speed,
so great that we can outrun any missile or anything else fired at us.
And have it marked on the bottom, you know: "Made in the U.S.!"
So, uh somebody here is not being particularly honest.
So do we have an overpopulation problem,
or is it possible that we could actually put a biosphere around different planets?
Well, you see, here we're back and forth,
and we hear these great, great cries about overpopulation,
and yes, those areas that's overpopulated.
But when you take a look at these areas, Africa, you know,
a mother has ten children and, and it's very fortunate, you know,
they think they're fortunate if two survive.
Well, if they had the necessities of life, they wouldn't be having 10 children.
They'd be very satisfied with the two, which would simply replace her and her husband.
But is it possible to make Mars or Venus or any other planets like the Earth?
Venus, of course, is a very hot planet,
and this is due to the magnetic structure of its field, the magnetic field.
And yes, we can clean those fields up, and yes, we can cool Venus down.
On the other hand, we can step into Mars,
and once more, by manipulating the magnetic fields, we can produce an atmosphere
which once more will bring back the water that used to be on Mars,
which is very obvious by space probes that there was water on Mars.
And yes, we can make it a very livable planet, just as livable and beautiful as our planet Earth.
So while people are fighting in the mid-east over areas of several miles,
you could actually, with this technology, develop a plan whereby everyone would have plenty of room to live in.
Absolutely. Absolutely.
If you look around the world at the population, you know, they're centered.
They're centered. We have these vast, vast areas of deserts.
Now, there's no reason for those deserts to be there.
With this technology, we can convert any mass to any element that we want.
And so to irrigate the deserts and make them a very livable place is not a problem.
It's just a technology. No problem.
And that's when you're opening up these vast areas that can be repopulated.
Now, can your technology also be utilized to destroy all cancers and viruses?
Well, yes, but now you're back into a completely different field, Jeff, and this is very technical.
But yes, of course, simply because we can take a virus and we can mutate it, trans-mutate it,
or anything else we want to do with it, and of course, and indeed, this is just what happened,
is that normally, friendly viruses that live with us beautifully have been transmutated by high velocity particles.
And its developed this strand of... uh... of new diseases.
And there's going to be a lot more new diseases than AIDS.
Take a look at the yuppie flu, you know, syndrome going around.
This is simply the result of people being influenced by magnetic fields,
and if they would check their homes, their places, they would find that they're living underneath a transformer.
So you're saying that anyone that lives near a transformer is in grave danger?
Grave, very grave danger -- not only to themselves, but their offspring because there being genetic change involved.
Would this relate to child leukemia or crib death?
Absolutely. A child is very, very susceptible. Crib-death falls into the same line, except that an infant is subjected to a given magnetic field.
And for an example, let's run a wire below or alongside of an infant's crib.
And whether that wire is a washer, or dryer, or whatever it may be,
And the infant's breathing hooks into this magnetic pulse.
The dryer is shut off, the pulse stops, and the baby stops breathing.
It's not complex. It's very simple.
It's just a matter of experimenting, experimenting and taking a look at the truth.
So you have all sorts of engines and generators designed, I understand. Is this correct, Lloyd?
Which require no external refueling, no gasoline, no fossil fuels, no nuclear, not even solar collectors?
Absolutely not. I've got... By the way, I've taken many of these designs within the past couple of weeks
and have been burning them because I've gotten some outright threats here.
But uh... You've got some what?
I have gotten some outright threats and if someone's going to blow my brains out, they're not going to get my work.
You've actually been destroying documents because people have been threatening you?
Yes, I thought you were aware of that. I thought I mentioned that.
No, you haven't.
Yes, we can build, if you want to call it an automobile, we can build an automobile with thrust.
That thrust is produced by an energy flow, and the energy flow is picked up from a rotating disk which uses a thrust.
So, here you have a situation where a 300%, again, efficiency, except it's in a different form.
We're not talking about mechanical thrust.
Yes, these things, I've done as much research as I can with the finance, and I've always done self-finance.
I've done as much research as I can.
Lloyd, I understand that you also have developed, with the knowledge of gravity, you have developed craft which can actually go up to the speed of light squared.
This is true. However, when you get into that area of C squared,
now you're getting into completely new phenomena.
For an example, we talked about gravity, and we talked about gravity being a bubble.
When you get into space, you find many, many bubbles, and some of these bubbles are as big as a total of 50 galaxies.
That's a big bubble.
When you get to these velocities, if you get into that bubble, you now have approached what they have looked for for so long,
and your time-space-continuance.
And so now velocity in itself becomes completely...
