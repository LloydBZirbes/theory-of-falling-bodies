cannot be seen by the existing scientific community because they do not have the correct foundation for physics.
As a matter of fact, the planet Earth does not have a nickel steel core producing a permanent magnet.
As a matter of fact, the very core of the Earth is hollow. It must contain probably steam, although it could be a lighter element of a lighter element, but definitely hollow.
That is in the respect that the general public might see as hollow. Definitely hollow. No steel core at all.
So that would indicate that we're not actually being pulled down to the Earth. Modern physics says that we're being pulled down.
When we jump up in the air and we come back down, it's because we're being pulled down. How would you explain that?
You're being pushed down because you have gravity being extracted from the surface of the Earth. We're talking about the Earth here.
And this gravity is being extracted at an angle. And this is a very slight angle, and that angle... that particle of gravity moves all the way around the Earth, and each time it moves around.
It slowly increases its orbit.
Ok, now, when you follow this angle through these very minute bubbles --
