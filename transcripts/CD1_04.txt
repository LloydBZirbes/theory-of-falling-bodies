It got further, and this, again, developed with the many, many years I've done on gravity,
at which time, after countless failures, incidentally, I did put together a unit that
produced gravity, and when you start understanding gravity, you can see the problem very clearly,
and with further application of the generator that I, myself, had built, these lines, they
make the magnetic lines of the planet Earth, can indeed be cleared. These undesirable particles
can be removed, and it's the only way out.
So there actually is a way to cleanse the ionosphere of these particles.
Very definitely.
Both the high-velocity particles from the fission generators, fission reactors, and
also the CFCs?
Absolutely.
So there's actually a way to clean the chlorofluorocarbons from the ionosphere?
Well, I'm not even concerned about CFCs because they are not the major problem.
But I'm stating this for those who still believe the CFCs are the problem.
Well, if they would be the problem, we certainly can clean them up very quick.
Now, as I understand, you have said that there are not four forces, which modern physics
says, and even a fifth or a sixth force, but there is actually only one force, and that
is gravity.
Can you explain this?
Well, when you start to look at gravity, you quickly discover that gravity is the only
force that exists.
Everything is gravity.
Now, I'm using gravity in the term that the scientific community is using gravity.
Gravity is the only energy that exists.
Gravity is the only thing that continuously exists.
Mass is simply the result of gravity that has been slowed down, thereby producing particles
which, in turn, produces the atoms, the elements, etc., etc.
Gravity is an eternal force, and it is the only force that exists.
When we speak of gravity, of course, this is a major part of the equation which I have
formulated and worked with, and it works out very perfectly.
It quickly corrects Newton, for an example.
But gravity is the major function of the equation, simply stating that G, gravity equals
mass at the rate of C squared, and this works out very nice.
And if we want to apply this to Albert Einstein,
Albert Einstein's seen energy as electrical energy, and took it separate from mass.
As a matter of fact, his electrical energy is mass, and therefore his equation is simply non-functional.
If I was to make a statement on gravity, I think what I would have to say is gravity
is the only true energy that exists.
Gravity is the creative force.
All things that exist come from gravity.
So now gravity has two different aspects, repulsive and attractive force.
Is that correct?
This is true.
Absolutely.
This is true.
This is what you've talked about in your paper.
Can you explain the difference between gravity A, attractive gravity, and gravity B, repulsive
force?
Gravity is gravity.
It's a matter of what direction its velocity is in which determines is it an attracting
force, or is it a repulsive force?
Gravity A, which is extracted from all falling bodies -- that is the attracting force -- extracts
from the surface of any falling body.
We can go ahead and say it actually begins itself below the surface, but we make it simple.
We'll say it's from the surface of any falling body.
Falling body, just for our lay listeners, could refer to the Earth, or the Sun, or any body
in motion.
This is correct.
This is correct.
The sun is a falling body, the earth is a falling body, all the planets are a falling
body.
Our star system is a falling body, the entire galaxy is falling, and indeed, galaxy systems
are falling, and they're all falling in corresponding with the whole universe, which in turn is
