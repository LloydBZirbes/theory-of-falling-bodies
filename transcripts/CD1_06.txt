The very mute devil is going passing through our objects, our objects, okay?
And so while you're standing and talking or jumping up to your own falling back,
it's just not that you're being pulled back, you're literally being pushed back
by these billions and billions of particles of gravity that's passing through your body.
They're passing at an angle and that angle continuously pushes to the surface of our body.
So what is light now?
Light is now.
Are we able to go beyond the speed of light?
You can obtain velocity slightly greater than the value of C, but always slightly greater.
It would be wise to say in general, mass cannot exceed the speed of light.
So what happens to light if you could accelerate it faster?
Then it simply will not accelerate faster.
It's simply because when you reach that point, it converts back into gravity, into a bubble of nothing.
And this is due to the expansion of the very, very, very mute particles.
The atom will break right on down, keep on breaking down, and it will play you right down to your singular particle.
And this actually expands to such a large degree that it forms a bubble, a bubble of nothing, and that's your gravity.
The gravity bubbles.
Right.
So how fast can these gravity bubbles go?
That's what I'm referring to.
C squared.
C squared.
Yeah, this is very debatable, and all I can go is by the application of my own mathematics, and I see C squared as the ultimate velocity.
Now what are black holes?
This is a term that's so crazy that it's very difficult for me even to respond to it.
Because now you see you're looking at something that is functioned, it simply is nothing to approach.
Well, what are these supposed black holes out in space where light is being sucked into them?
What is happening there?
Well, there are many situations which has taken place.
For example, we have a quasar, and of course the big question is, you know, what is a quasar?
This is what it does, you know, and we recently discovered one that we've been watching.
Why is it happening?
Why is it taking place?
But what has happened is now you have a body.
The smaller, how the larger the body is, that was diverted from its normal, normal orbit.
And therefore, when it was diverted, it comes to a point of zero velocity.
And it's a point of zero velocity, the mass contained within, completely identifies.
Therefore, it releases all the space within the mass itself.
Of course, mass is not mass.
People think of the piece of glass or whatever, it's just a solid.
As a matter of fact, it is more than 99.9% of that which they think is solid is really space.
And so when you have diverted mass, you come to a point where it comes to an absolute rest that completely densifies.
At this point, space, that which work could give it a mass, is expelled.
So you don't think there's actually any hole there?
No, there's no hole there whatsoever.
Okay, then if we continue on, there's no way that any mass can, for any length of time, obtain absolute rest value.
It's just a very short period of time and then it's going to pick up with the gravitational pull of the surrounding bodies
and once more it will obtain motion.
And with this velocity, once more, the densified mass must accept space, gravity that is, so that it will expand.
Now in this process of expanding, all of a sudden you have all energies available, all gravity available, all space, all mass rushing into this body
and therefore you see a black hole.
But all it really is, is mass that has been densified and is now picking up velocity and is increasing its volume to a normal size.
Now how did the universe start? Was it actually the Big Bang Theory or what?
No, no.
This is, if we're looking at the Big Bang Theory, we have to go back and look at the situation we just looked at.
And it's just simply, if both foreholds and both, you know, flag, they'll have no idea how a citizen has, they've got to stand up in front of a class and talk about the Big Bang Theory.
How do you believe the universe started?
Now, you know, you speak of the universe and, you know, this is it, this is it.
The universe, one of the better factors, the universe that we call our universe, is just a very, very mute particle in a vast, vast vortex of many, many, many universes.
And so when you say how did the universe itself start, well, it did start as all things must start and it will die as all things must die.
But to go through the whole cycle, we have to carefully study falling bodies and very honestly, Jeff, I would have to stand in front of you with a chalkboard in an attempt to try to show you what I'm talking about.
But basically all of the different things which we're talking about go back to the simple study of falling bodies, which modern physics is assuming are one way, but it's actually another way.
Absolutely. If any other scientific community would just assume for a few minutes that yes, these tests are correct and if they would look at it and apply their own math, they wouldn't have to use my math, apply their own math.
They would quickly see that, you know, we're destroying ourselves. They would quickly see the function of the universe. They would quickly see what it plays out here.
They would understand what a pulsar is. They would quickly understand these things. But as long as they're hooked into Galileo's hypothetical test, there's no way they can see it.
Now you proved your theory with an actual gravity generator, correct?
This is correct. The gravity generator was basically designed that the star was basically structured after the function of a star, that is, a body such as we call a sun.
So you built a gravity generator and what happened?
The gravity generator went into operation in the shop. There were things in the shelves, everything, virtually hanging, walls on pegs, etc.
And all these things simply floated off into the air. Just floated off into the air. And me personally, I found myself up on the ceiling looking down.
This all took place within a very short period of time, in several seconds.
So modern physics, of course, says that that's impossible.
That's right. Absolutely impossible.
And then if you could actually produce a gravity generator, then you've destroyed the foundation against improving it with technical physics.
Well, I already destroyed that in 1961 with my test on falling bodies. The scientific community will not accept them.
Now you have sent this material all over the scientific community in America, correct?
It's far more than America. When I first started mailing in 1961, it went to the major universities and I continued the mailings to all governmental bodies.
The mailings that I continued to one mailing with extensive information was sent to every major university in the United States, every state university in the 50 states.
I think then it's been moved, the information has been moved into Russia, China, Australia, New Zealand, England, all through Europe.
Yeah, it's very widespread.
And yet it has not been recognized yet. Why is this?
Nobody wants to make a test on falling bodies. A very simple test.
Could it also be that if this was proved to be true, that Galileo was wrong and modern physics is based on a mistake, in essence,
that they would know then that the nuclear reactors are actually putting out millions of tons of these particles per day and that all nuclear reactors would have to be closed immediately?
So there are other factors involved here which is probably why this information has not become common knowledge.
There is no question about that. There is complete opposition from the military industrial complex.
