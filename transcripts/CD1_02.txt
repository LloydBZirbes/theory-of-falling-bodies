This is a step further, and this is again developed with the many, many years I've done on gravity,
at which time, after countless failures, incidentally, I did put together a unit that produced gravity.
And when you start understanding, we released a paper in the past year,
and within the past year, about two months after we released our paper, NASA also said
that the ozone depletion may be due to higher velocity particles in the atmosphere,
in the higher atmosphere, and so they make all of these different statements.
It seems like people don't realize that when they use the word NASA,
they are not talking one person, they're talking thousands of physicists and engineers
and they all have their own opinions.
In regards to the methane, you can go in the laboratory and prove that methane does not destroy ozone,
as a matter of fact is methane produces ozone,
and it produces on such a scale that the methane itself would produce more ozone
than the CFCs are destroying, but yes, CFCs do destroy ozone.
Now, the CFCs, the chlorofluorocarbons, NASA contends that the CFCs are rising up into the higher atmosphere.
Is this possible, or are these very heavy particles?
Well, your carbon's very heavy, yeah.
Sure, if they'll get into the atmosphere, they're getting into the atmosphere,
especially over the magnetic south pole, which you refer to as the magnetic.
