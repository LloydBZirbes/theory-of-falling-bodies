This carbon is very heavy.
So it's not actually a valid answer to say that CFCs or chlorofluorocarbons are destroying the ozone.
No, they give this answer because that's what they can produce in the laboratory under given conditions.
And yet many scientists say ozone depletion at its present course may bring extinction to animal and plant life within 10, 20, 50, 100 years.
Yes, I know they're saying that, yeah.
Now, can you explain, is it actually the electron theory based technology based on a mistake of Galileo's that is possibly causing this whole problem?
It very definitely is. I've carefully calculated the math over and over to make sure that I knew what I was talking about.
And very definitely, CFCs have, there is a factor, definitely a factor.
But the major depletion we are seeing is due to the magnetic field of the planet Earth being laden with.
That is, they are getting heavier and heavier and heavier.
And this is due to electron theory and of course the extended nuclear theory.
So we have millions of tons of high energy particles being released through our fission reactors, electrical systems and radio transmitters
into the higher atmosphere each day which have laden our magnetic fields with debris, correct?
Correct, that's correct.
And now, what happens when we have these millions of tons of mass which are not normally there, there? What will happen to the magnetic fields?
Okay, now if we can look at the line of force, that is one flux line, it has a given mass value.
This given mass value has a given rotation, a given value of inertia.
Now, as you increase the mass contained within that line, the inertia is so much greater and thusly it simply does not want to
retain the same velocity as the body that is turning, which is the body in this case, the planet Earth.
Therefore, as these lines of force, the magnetic fields become heavier and heavier, they begin to shear and break at an ever increasing lower altitude from the Earth.
Now, I understand that last several weeks ago, there was a show on, actually it was reported on the news that the Van Allen belt, I guess,
that there has been a shift report in what Van Allen actually recorded and what they're recording now.
Well, now this gets to be a little complex, but Van Allen, when he first found the shearing point, it was 45,000 miles above the Earth at the equator.
But then later testing indicated that there was not just this 45,000 miles above the Earth's belt, but this belt had grown wider and wider.
Well, eventually they detected a lot of actual nuclear debris, radioactive particles below the Van Allen belt.
Well, now this has continued and at this time it is approximately 16,000 to 18,000 miles above the equator of the Earth.
And at this point, the temperature is running 2000 degrees.
So, it's quite amazing that 45,000 miles above the Earth, there used to be a layer, 2000 degrees centigrade,
and now basically that has shifted to only 16 to 18 miles above the Earth, correct?
16,000, 16 to 18,000.
Excuse me, 16 to 18,000.
Right.
Now, is it true, do you think, that this has been there for millions of years at 45,000?
I'm sure there's been some variation over, you know, if we're looking at a billion year period.
And we can set these variations into earthquakes and volcanic -- you know -- various volcanic actions.
And so, if we want to look at volcanic eruptions on Earth, we can quickly tie that with the exact height of what is now called the Van Allen belt, the outer Van Allen belt.
So, something is really going on, because over, within 100 years, this belt has shifted more than double.
Really, in the last 15 years.
15 years.
What is the long-term goal, result, what will be the long-term result of this shift?
Okay.
This shift, which is really a shearing and slipping of magnetic lines of force, as they become heavier, will get ever closer and closer to the surface of the Earth.
And of course, once they're close enough, there just is no way for life to survive on this planet.
2000 degrees melts lead, you know, silver, gold. It will evaporate all the water and nothing can survive.
So, this layer, this 2000 degrees centigrade, started at 45,000 miles, within 15 years, it's gone down to 16,000 to 18,000 miles.
Is it still going down?
Of course.
I mean, who can see what's going to happen next year, but if you look at the past and say, here's what's been happening, you know, it's not too hard to predict to say, yes, it's going to continue towards the surface of the Earth.
And again, this is because the magnetic fields are becoming laden with debris from our nuclear reactors, our weapons testing, and our radio transmitters and electrical technologies.
Yes, and the electrical transmission, you know, the long wires and all this.
Yeah, definitely.
What are electrical wires doing?
Your highlines?
Okay, anytime you transport what they refer to as energy -- I do not -- but electrical energy, you have a loss.
They have strived to obtain more efficiency, and I think the latest report I read is, now they have about a 3% loss.
Now, if you want to take, you know, a million megawatts transmitter, a generator, and then you're going to string those wires out for thousands of miles, and you have a 3% loss, you have that total amount of mass from the generator, and 3% of that is being lost into the atmosphere.
And of course, the Earth itself, you have a 3% loss, and this is mass.
Have you predicted how long in our present course this will take till this layer reaches the Earth?
Well, of course, we won't be around to talk about it.
However, the influence that it has is already clearly being seen.
For an example, our air currents across the various oceans have increased in velocity, you know, we take an annual norm.
And in the past 30 years, they have continuously increased in velocity, progressively, each year.
This is one of the effects, and that in itself is not yet drastic, but it will become drastic.
This, in turn, is shifting all the weather patterns.
The people on the equator are, well, they're going to be in a drought, and drought is going to become worse and worse and worse.
And of course, these drought conditions will expand worldwide, along with intensified tornadoes, hurricanes, low pressure areas.
I think you people had one here the other day with the lowest low pressure area ever read.
I think right off the west coast there. And these are some of the results.
Now, how long will this take until catastrophes might happen, which could affect potentially millions of people?
I really don't believe we're going to get through the year 1988 without a very major catastrophe happening.
Now, what are you talking about? Earthquake? Volcano?
There's various manifestations. Now, keep in mind the magnetic field of the Earth.
If you can picture this in your mind, imagine this.
And now keep in your mind that this entire magnetic field must pass through the center of the Earth from one pole to the next in a matter of 10 minutes.
Now, with this ever-increasing weight with the magnetic field, this in turn is entering the Earth, and the very core of the Earth is becoming hotter and hotter and hotter.
This in turn results in great expansions, which in turn is going to produce tremendous volcano action, tremendous earthquakes.
And so it may well manifest in volcanoes that might completely wipe out Japan, or an earthquake that may completely wipe out the west coast, or Peru,
or simply severe winds -- more of a warning -- like what went through Britain and completely destroyed their great trees of which they have been so proud of so many thousands of years.
Now, so we have increased volcanic activity and hurricane and earthquake activity, all kinds of weather patterns changing. How violent will this become?
Very violent. Very violent.
Well, most coasts, as long as they stand there, will find that the tides, for an example, are getting higher and higher.
They will find that the normal winds are higher and higher.
So the coastal areas on the whole planet is going to be washed away, and this will be progressive.
We've seen a lot of damage in the last ten years, and it is more progressive each year.
How long will it take for this to wash California away, for instance?
Well, I don't think you have to be concerned about California being washed away.
I would be much more concerned about severe earthquakes followed by some brand new volcanoes.
What kind of time period are you seeing? Within ten years?
Well, if something isn't done within ten years, there will be very few people living on this planet.
The ones that will be living here in ten years will be in deep underground shelters.
So you're saying within ten years, unless our problems are corrected, there will be no animal life existing above the surface of the ground?
No, no plant life either.
No plant life or animal life?
There will be some marine life, but that too will be drastically reduced.
How can you say that this could occur within ten years?
Because all you have to do is look at the past and take a look at the progression of what's happening, and then simply follow that progression through.
And you come up with these extraordinary figures.
Now, some people say, well, we don't really see that it's not happening that quick.
It's going to be more like 30 or 40 or 50 years. We've got plenty of time left.
Can you give me some specifics about what exactly?
Well, that's one. The Van Allen Belt from 45,000 to 18,000 miles. That's quite a bit.
Now, our global temperature has increased about, I think, one and a half degrees in the last ten years.
Yeah.
But is that so significant, one and a half degrees, or will it be five degrees?
Very, very significant. When you consider, look what you're heating up.
Consider how much water is on the earth and how much land mass, and now you're going to warm that up one and a half degrees.
This amount of heat is a tremendous, you know, just, the figures are so high in heat dispersion that to put it into figures is difficult to do.
I don't care if you're using powers of tens or what, it's a fantastic figure, the required energy to do this.
So we've definitely got a problem. Do you see any solution to this problem?
There is, of course, a number of solutions. First of all, we have an electron theory and, of course, the military is saying, well, we have to have fission generators, which, of course, is not true.
And they know it, they simply want the plutonium that's produced, but to replace existing electron theory with a solid theory.
And this has to be done rapidly. We have something to replace it, but it must be replaced.
Nobody is going to go back to dwelling in caves. We don't have enough caves anymore.
And so the technology does exist, and we simply have to start converting.
So you actually have designed, am I correct, actual technology which can be implemented to clean these high energy particles out of the atmosphere?
Yeah, now this is a step further. And this is again developed with the many, many years I've done on gravity, at which time, after countless failures, incidentally, I did put together a unit that produced gravity.
And when you start understanding gravity, you can see the problem very clearly.
