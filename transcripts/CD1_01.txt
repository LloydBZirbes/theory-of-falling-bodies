Judy Collins. As those of you who have been listening a long time know, we've been following
the free energy story for several years amid the great peril, but we are carrying it on
and I get all sorts of mail and this one was another free energy guy. Oh boy. Well,
I looked at the book. This is about 300 page book and I do not present myself as a science
person with a real heavy scientific background or scientific mind and certainly not a physicist,
but this stuff seemed acceptable as a proposition that it is real, sort of look real to me and this
is beyond De Palma and beyond Newman, although in definitely in concert with him seems to be
working on the same stuff they are, but he's been doing it longer and he's come up not only with
a generator, claims a generator that generate 300% efficiency, which of course they have running in
India now and patented there, 300%, but that's only one of his claims. He claims an anti gravity
generator, which is we're talking about a whole different ball of wax and again any scientist
listening in order to prevent ulcers, I think that you should turn off the radio, listen to
something else because this will disturb you, but the claims sound interesting. The experiments are
not that difficult and sounds cogent to me. You know this fractal of behavior, success in a
field, go back to actually experience the original founders of the field, the basic books, the basic
theories and discover them for yourself and chances are, chances are very good that nobody's
cracked those books for maybe decades and you're going to find things which contradict what is said
about them. You'll find in academia for instance that the knowledge of the founding fathers of the
field or the books are summarized with a one or two sentence summary and everybody knows the summary
and over the generations it's assumed that that two line summary of what the book says is what the
book said and when you go back to the book and read it yourself you find that the summary was really
not very good. So we are going to put this particular telescope on Galileo.
I have a one hour interview on tape and I have the book here and I'm going to read a couple of
letters that are at the beginning of the book and so you can get a sort of a background before we
listen to him because he doesn't deal with too much of this background.
So I'm reading now from a booklet from Zerbe's Z-I-R-B-E-S, Zerbe's Enterprises
Division of Unified Atomic Research, Unified Atomic Research, Route 1, Box 68,
Forst and Minnesota 56330, area code telephone 6122945140. This was a letter written in 1987,
March. I have become aware that you've taken an interest in searching for a repulsive force in
nature which counteracts gravity and I'm writing to offer a suggestion as to how you can gain
immediate proof that such a force does indeed exist. Since you are in effect at square one
in your search I will recommend you begin with a simple and straightforward test
first conducted by myself and then associate in the early 1960s which I guarantee yields a dramatic
result and offers irrefutable proof that Galileo's work was incomplete at best.
In this particular test I suggest using a 10 pound sphere of carbon and a 10 pound sphere of iron.
The circumference of the carbon sphere will of course be greater than that of the iron,
but this factor is very important to the result of the test as you will soon see.
You will also need to construct a drop box large enough to accommodate the two spheres
and to incorporate some sort of a triggering mechanism that will ensure the spheres are released
simultaneously. To acquire the absolute proof you are looking for the distances of the drops
should be at least 2,000 feet. We used an open mine shaft in northern Minnesota and that site
worked out very well. After taking into account air flows, lunar winds, etc., make your drop.
In our tests we had set up a high speed camera near the impact plane to record the results,
but if you have an extra person at hand to make a visual observation the camera wouldn't be
absolutely necessary the result is so pronounced that it cannot be missed.
You will find that even after all possible interfering factors are accounted for the carbon
sphere will impact after a 2,000 foot fall long before the iron sphere strikes the impact plane.
We found this particular test to be of great value because it eliminated the possibility that air
resistance was a major factor in discrepancies we found between rates of acceleration of different
elements in some or of the other tests we had conducted. Our result showed that the iron sphere
was still six feet from the impact plane at the instant the carbon sphere impacted, proving that
different elements falling in a gravitational field accelerate at different rates, proving that
different elements falling in a gravitational field accelerate at different rates. The striking
unmistakable result yielded by this test qualifies it as an excellent starting point and I recommend
it highly for the reason that it quickly establishes a solid working foundation from which to proceed.
I realize that you may not have the facilities at hand to allow you to easily arrange to run this
test and so as you will notice I've sent an identical letter to some of your fellow researchers
who are also looking for the repulsive force. It is my great hope that if it is beyond your
present means to run the simple test then perhaps it will be within someone else's means.
After more than 25 years of talking about a repulsive force it is gratifying for me to see
persons such as yourself exploring the Aadiyadiyada, exploring the Avenue of Research and I congratulate
you. Should you continue this quest into the actions of and reasons for the repulsive force
it will ultimately lead you to unity of all things and many new technologies vital to the
survival of this planet in her time of crisis. If I can be of any assistance to you in suggesting
further tests sharing the results to the numerous tests I've conducted I'm answering any questions
you may have I'm willing to oblige. Lloyd Zerbe's Director Project Stardust.
Second letter written November 87.
In close you'll find segment one of the material you requested which is a short
straightforward synopsis of tests conducted on free falling bodies during 1960-61.
If you have any background in physics you will immediately recognize the impact of these results
on existing accepted physical quote law unquote. I had always assumed Galileo had actually made
tests on falling bodies and only recently did I discover that his were imaginary tests.
The result of his reasoning out the question of rates of acceleration. Of course he knew nothing
of atomic or molecular structure at the time but evidently that's not a point of concern to modern
scientists who aren't even bothered by the knowledge that Galileo's suppositions were never
physically demonstrated but I thought I saw a photograph of him in the in the Leaning Tower of
Pisa. As far as I've been able to determine I am the first person to ever actually check
Galileo's assumptions and he was completely in error even so every attempt I have made through
the years to notify persons in government industry and education have been met with
everything from accusations I was a liar to simple silence. Why? What's going on here? I have yet
to find an answer to these questions. My initial disclosure of these tests and results back in
1961 was very exciting to me. This was something big but the responses were definitely not aimed
at encouraging my work. The kindest respondent simply mailed me a textbook on physics,
high school level of course. Being much younger than then I decided to force the issue by conducting
a demonstration of these tests. Physicists and professors from nearby states or the
representatives were extended invitations to attend. At the appointed time and place I waited
but not one person showed up. The message was quite clear by this time and it was a terrible
blow to our morale. What to do? We knew the results were correct. We'd witnessed it with our own
eyes and there was no mistake. Galileo was incorrect and there was no question about it but none of
these persons who should care very deeply wanted to hear about it. Was it professional snobbery
and the fact that I hadn't a PhD which accounted for their attitudes or was it some other perhaps
deeper reason? It was impossible to guess. All I knew was that with a wife and young children's
support attempting to earn a PhD was out of the question. Yet I also knew that I couldn't just
let the whole thing drop. The results were correct and the cornerstone of physics was therefore in
error. It doesn't take a PhD to realize that if current beliefs regarding falling bodies is wrong
then those subsequent beliefs which have sprung from the foundation of falling bodies are also
due for some serious examination. At the very least there was no other option than to carry on with
my work. I won't bore you with endless details but will only say that the next few years were spent
trying to figure out what was happening with the bodies that could have produced those results.
Unaccounted, uncounted experiments and thousands of hours of study later I had some of my answers.
Not only was the theory logical but the mathematical functions worked perfectly
without the use of assumptions, adjustments or open parameters. Exciting as all of this was,
it was also very disturbing. For now it was clear that Newton's work on gravitation was also incorrect.
This brings us up to the mid-1960s and the next disclosure, this time of the test results and
theory of falling bodies. It was a much larger mailing than the first attempt in 1961. Well,
over 100 university physics departments, government agencies and foundations,
but the responses were quite similar to 1961. I fully realized the disclosures were very rough
as I was working with limited resources and was by this time alone in the effort. But even so,
the information was there and I was so open to question as to nearly plead with someone to
inquire further. Why no one did is still difficult for me to reconcile. Science is supposed to be
a search for the truth, not protection of the status quo, and yet I had run up against this
ultimate old boys network and it didn't seem to be any way into this very exclusive club.
Still, knowing what I by this time was quite confident of, I couldn't walk away from this work
and so I decided to focus my attention on a nearby, very large falling body, our sun.
For the next six years, the majority of my spare time was spent working on the question of how the
sun was structured and how and why it generated when the smaller bodies in our solar system did not.
How were they different? How were they the same? These appear to be simple questions,
but they quickly become very complex indeed. Hard data on the sun was difficult to find,
even though theories on this or that aspect of solar action were common enough, underlying all
of what we call the miscellaneous, I guess, MISC period theories, the miscellaneous theories,
in quotes, that is flares, sunspots, etc. Underneath the misc theories was the strong belief
that the sun was a gigantic nuclear reactor. The problem with this opposition, however,
quickly presented itself. Ultimately, nuclear theory traces its history back to old accepted
beliefs regarding falling bodies and gravitation, and as such could not be depended upon as an
accurate foothold in this study. In other words, I began at the very beginning, gathering, sorting,
and analyzing data. I had begun to suspect early on that suns are multi-bodied, but it took quite
some time to figure out how they generated if indeed they were not the nuclear reactors many
believe them to be. The answer was obvious once I finally saw it, and again, the math function
perfectly and was exactly in accord with all my previous work. The sun is not the huge fusion
generator scientists speak of with such certainty. Rather, it is comprised of many thousands of
individual bodies and generates and generates due to the interaction of these many bodies.
What on earth is viewed as fusion is no more than the assimilation of pre-mass
into mass particles and then into systems of particles. It was with renewed excitement that
I sent out these findings, for I truly expected someone to take interest. This model not only
showed hows and whys, but also brought into question nuclear and electron theory. What scientists
could pass this up? A few months later I had the answer, and to this day I have not heard from
even one of them. My frustration was fast becoming disbelief, the math work, the model work, yet there
was no interest. What was going on in the community? I didn't spend time worrying about it because I
realized that if the sun's generation was mechanical, not nuclear, then I should be able to reproduce it
mechanically. There was no reason I couldn't check the theory myself. I knew motion was involved,
as well as magnetic fields and gravitation, but in the beginning I used up a good deal
of time and money focusing on the exact mechanics employed by the sun rather than on the principle
involved. During this period I devoted a great deal of time to what I now thought of simply as
the project, and I felt confident I was on the right track. I learned much about magnetic fields
and felt ever more certain that electron and nuclear theory are seriously flawed.
Rising suspicions of possible dangers from man-made magnetic fields prompted me to begin
experiments testing the effects of an electromagnetic field on living things.
These soon began to yield frightening, fascinating results, and were then expanded to other test
subjects in magnetic fields of varying strength and content. This became a long-term series of
experiments on earthworms, rodents, chickens, and plants, and the indications were horrifying.
A person can't just keep results like this to themselves. So another disclosure was assembled
and mailed out to power companies, government agencies, and educators.
This time I did receive responses, but none were favorable.
Interestingly, most of the response attacked me personally, accusing me of being a communist,
of trying to cause a panic, or best yet of being a fool advocating a return to cave dwelling.
The interesting thing is that there were no outright denials of my results,
and omission, I think, is important. Could it be that these scientists were no more than
representatives of the vested interests? It was beginning to appear so.
By the late 1970s, the project had become very close to a personal obsession, and little else
seemed very important. My family had long been resentful of the time and resources devoted to
the project, and by this time they'd all seen enough negative feedback that they were convinced
I'd gone over the edge. None of them knew or wanted to know anything about what I was doing,
yet I was pressured to stop this insanity. The net result of this conflict was ever-increasing
isolation from everyone. This was a difficult time, and when I say my work, or I did, it's not ego
speaking, it's accurate reporting. I was on my own, and when the resentment and tension at home
became unbearable, I rented a shop area and moved in. I tried one more model, and if it didn't work,
I'd quit. I'd identified the principle involved. Now, I just had to figure out the
most efficient mechanical design possible. The arrangement I decided on was usual,
unusual, in that as far as I could determine, it had never been tried before, but if my theory was
correct, it had to work. This was it. I began building, using whatever materials I could find
at low cost, that is mostly junkyard scrap, etc. I wound the inductors myself. Again,
great details at this point would be inappropriate when the most important fact is that when the
unit was assembled and the coils energized, it worked. I had produced gravity. The theory was
correct, and now I could prove it. The unit was admittedly crude, but in the test run,
it had produced enough power to set everything in the shop into motion,
and I'd been injured by flying debris. I had six weeks in the hospital to think about what
had happened and to plan ways of controlling these emissions, which I realized represented
not only a new power source, but also could be developed into the ultimate propulsion system,
one based on natural repulsion. Dozens of tests needed to be run, then a new model must be constructed,
and further testing done. Modifications would be made as needed. Then I could finally begin
demonstrations and secure financing to continue testing, and finally a prototype would be built,
a craft. There were a thousand things to be done, and even though I was in a great deal of pain,
I couldn't remember ever feeling better about the future. I couldn't wait to get started.
Nothing went according to my plans. When I was in the hospital, the shop and my van were burned.
The police assumed arson, but there was no logical motive and no suspects. Nothing had been ensured.
The unit was ruined, as were the scopes, meters, and other equipment it had taken so many years
to accumulate. Worst of all was the loss of the books, theme books, full of notes, both at the
shop and those burned by family members cleaning house in my absence. Suddenly I had nothing to
show for 25 years of work, and I felt lost. The next year or so was a stressful period.
And not much of anything was accomplished. The situation at home became more strained,
and any mention of the project was met with open hostility. If it would have been possible
to give up, 1981 would have been the year I quit, but it was just out of the question.
Too much of who I was had merged with the project. One major area was left to look into,
so I tuned to a turn to atomic structure. This meant studying particle physics and trying to
make sense of the masses of data and conflicting theories was the most difficult task I had ever
undertaken. In the end, it paid off. I had functional math which revealed many thousands
of mass particles within each and every atomic system. Modern models show an atom to be structured
much like a mini-solar system, and this is correct when we view it from a great distance.
If we were able to look closer, however, we would see each atom more closely
resemble a complex micro-galaxy. The math worked. Sequences appeared, and it became
clear that what is currently called radiant or electrical energy is no more than minute,
high-velocity particles of mass. Quantum also was flawed.
I now understood the nature of gravity, the only true energy, and saw that velocity
is the key factor. When gravity slows to below the velocity of light, it becomes mass.
When mass is accelerated to beyond the velocity of light, it breaks down into gravity.
Gravity was continuously being produced by bodies in motion, huge, multi-bodied sun systems being
the biggest producers. Everything that exists is but bits of dust in quotes from the stars.
I'd found unity in all things and along the way had also found the most meaningful project name,
stardust. I sent out a limited number of disclosures regarding the generator and gravity,
but by this time I had no great expectation, so I wasn't surprised at the limited response.
Still, I was getting worried. My blood pressure, longer concerned, suddenly shot into the stroke
range, and my doctor began urging hospitalization. In fact, the fact that no one around me understood
anything about project stardust frightened me terribly. If I were to die, all of it would be
lost. In desperation, I assembled hundreds of information packets and began the biggest mailing
effort yet. Each and every congressman in office during 1984 was notified of project stardust,
as was every other agency or person I could think of. Major universities, Purdue among them,
were also notified, and I literally begged for someone, anyone, to ask questions. Responses,
again, were minimal, but at least stardust was now on file here and there around the country,
which gave me a measure of comfort. If I died, stardust didn't necessarily die with me.
Right in this time frame, I found an ally who took an immediate interest in my work. She was at
that time taking some college classes, and though she had no great background in the sciences,
she learned quickly. Before long, she understood more about the work to assist me in preparing
material, and her moral support was very helpful. She was very interested in environmental issues,
so we looked in closer detail at the implications of nuclear and electron
theory technologies. When E. Fischbach came forward with talk of hypercharge, we were very
excited. Certainly the gravity test he referred to in the time article had to be those I'd sent
him in 1984. At least the door had officially opened a crack. Now perhaps the time was at hand.
Attempts to begin a formal correspondence with Mr. Fischbach were unsuccessful,
and I'm not certain as to why this was. We didn't let it concern us over much, though,
because we now saw there was more to worry about than what Mr. Fischbach was doing.
I'd known for quite a few years that the nuclear and electron theories were seriously flawed,
and were harmful to the environment, but until we began our detailed examination of the full
cycle effects of technologies based on these theories, I'd had no idea how truly
deadly they were. It quickly became clear that this planet was an extreme peril,
and that the ionospheric disruptions were just early symptoms of a terrible sickness,
and we were horrified. In August 1986, we began trying to alert environmental groups to the
situation, and all together hundreds of appeals for attention to the nuclear question were sent
out. Only one of the few respondents turned out to be a serious ally, but though through Mr. Bogart,
we initiated serious dialogue with two other environmental groups and began sending them
the information you have now requested. Three people doesn't sound like much,
but these three had networks of their own, so the potential for assimilation of information was great.
We've been working full time on this project for over a year now, and the process is slow,
but it's working. We've been told our material has now been translated into at least several
different languages and is being circulated overseas, so our hopes are high that nuclear energy
is finally being considered as a possible cause of the strange environmental phenomena now being
observed globally. Once a solid, determined group of people come together, we will be able to move
ahead swiftly, for the groundwork has already been done. The theory is correct, which means we can
utilize the capabilities of the generator to gather and restructure the deadly, unstable particles
released through fission and can replace harmful energy sources with natural energies. All we
need is people to join the effort. We've been plagued this past year with well-meaning persons
whose only fault is apathy. Some wait for a divine being to show up and save the day, while others
simply wait for someone else to do something. We've become resigned to the fact that it will
probably take a major disaster to really wake people up, and this is a shame, but there's no way
around it that we can see. Unfortunately, this disaster could come at any time, and it's likely
that when it comes, many will die who could have been saved. Will it come in the form of a major
implosion or an energy grab from the radiation belts, or will it be some other catastrophic
combination of factors? We don't have the data needed to predict, but when it happens, you can be
sure the only explanation for it will lie within the body of knowledge built from the foundation
of tests on falling bodies. I apologize for the accessible poem. So the points that he's making
is 13 points. Oh, this is a reading from a couple of letters in a booklet from the
Zerbe's Enterprises Division of Unified Atomic Research.

What this means.
1. A generator that is 300% efficient. 1 megawatt turns the generator and produces 3 megawatts
power. 2. The injection of contained gravity into any matter or mass which will gently expand the
mass and allow one to rearrange the atomic structure to produce any element that may be desired.
3. The injection of contained gravity which will result in a massive body being reduced to its singular
elements. 4. A barrier of attractive gravity which will screen undesirable particles from the
atmosphere and magnetic field of the earth. This can be used to normalize the ozone layer.
5. The injection of contained gravity into water, that is, rivers, lakes, oceans.
Reducing the compounds to their singular elements, that is pollutants, that we can reassemble the
oxygen and hydrogen to produce 100% water. It also works with salt water.
6. The application of gravity B, repulsive force, to propel craft to explore our solar system.
These craft are primitive but can achieve a velocity of up to five times the speed of light.
This craft has already been designed and can be built for only one million dollars.
That's less than a B1. 7. Attaching a gravity A barrier, attractive force,
to the aforementioned craft will allow travel at a velocity of up to C squared.
8. The manipulation of contained gravity A plus B to produce seamless magnetic structures,
metallic structures, seamless metallic structures.
9. The application of magnetic flows to inject or extract heat or cold from any given contained
area. 10. The application of magnetic fields to accelerate healing, improve the functioning
of immune system, destroy all cancers, etc. 11. Application of magnetic fields to produce
desirable genetic change in plant life resulting in great agricultural abundance.
12. The modulation of intelligence, audio and video on a pulsating gravity A generator will
result in new communication system which is not based on the deadly electron theory.
Instead of broadcasting unstable mass particles, frequencies, you broadcast gravity.
13. With the technology to build elements, you may build proteins. With research and
development, this can be applied to the replacement of computer chips with artificial intelligence.
And then the rest of the... It's a 300 page book. We just hit page one.
And some of the tests are they dropped two iron balls of equal weight and they landed at the
same time but farther apart. Then they dropped four balls of equal weight and size but composed
of different elements and the four balls hit bottom at different times. The demonstration
of his theory that the different... It's not just the weight or gravity but it's the element
involved. Some elements fall faster than others, whatever their size. And dropping 20 balls and
three balls and different shapes and sizes of balls. There's a introduction to the theory and
some magazine and newspaper articles. And this is just for the... Those who are quite interested.
And before we get to the interview with Mr. Zerbe's, which comes in a minute,
I'll give you the... Where you can get this book if you want to study it yourself.

K-P-F-K Los Angeles, about an hour.
Wrong cassette.
Now Mr. Zerbe's.
Today is April 21, 1988. My name is Jeffrey Harrison. And today I am interviewing Mr. Lloyd Zerbe's.
Mr. Zerbe's is a scientist who although unknown to the world at large, has made some discoveries
which may radically evolve our understanding of physics, cosmology, and all natural phenomena.
He has put forth a grand unified theory with resultant technology which provides a solution
to our energy problems, space travel, and offers a method whereby all bodies of water in the
atmosphere may be cleaned of impurities and our Earth's dying ozone layer and magnetic field may
be restored to natural balance. Mr. Zerbe's, I understand your work is not based on presently
known or accepted principles of physics. No, as a matter of fact, is my work totally
destroys existing laws of physics. And that you have in fact conducted a large body of
tests which prove that some long-cherished assumptions regarding physics are wrong.
Can you explain, please? Well, this, the testing basically started to do with my
doctorate work which was a review of existing laws of physics. And this in turn led me to
gravity test of falling bodies. And it was through these tests that I discovered that
existing laws in regards to falling bodies is completely in error.
So you're referring now to Galileo's assumption that falling bodies accelerated
same velocity, correct? This is correct. And indeed, the word assumption is correct. Galileo
has never made tests on falling bodies. And it was clearly an assumption. And through the research
of the past 30 years, not only myself, but many others, I discovered that the only person who
actually done gravity test on falling bodies was myself and my staff. Now, what kind of results
did you find? We found that indeed there was a difference in the rate of acceleration of falling
bodies and various elements accelerated at different rates. We also discovered that the major factor
was the permeability of the body in question. Now, I understand that you performed one test
where you dropped a lead ball and a ball made of carbon of the same weight, is that correct?
That's correct. And obviously the carbon being much lighter element, the ball was much bigger.
Now, normal physics would state because of air resistance that the lead ball should have landed
first, but yet your carbon ball landed first, is that correct? Correct, absolutely correct.
So you did not perform these in a vacuum, but yet your results are still accurate?
No, they're very accurate. The test dropped for you as well. We had many
heights from 100 feet on 302,000 feet and our basic test was the 2000 foot fall,
definitely not in a vacuum. And of course, the vacuum would eliminate the air resistance factor
and we done this another way simply by using, as you mentioned, the carbon. The ball of carbon
was much bigger than the ball of lead. Now, the carbon protects the ground first.
Now, this may sound a little complicated to some people who have never studied physics.
But what we're basically saying here, what you're basically saying is that the work
which Galileo did was wrong, and that in turn was the foundation upon which Newton
and Einstein did their work. Yeah, Galileo now understands that I am not condemning Galileo.
I think he was a terrific mathematician. He turned up some very fellow discoveries.
But in the area of falling bodies, he never took a test on falling bodies,
nor did he ever make that statement. He simply was trying to reflect back on Aristotle, who in
turn had put forth an imaginary test. And these tests were accepted by the church. And of course,
the church in those days, that was the rule, that was the scientific community, that was everything.
And Galileo's proposal was only to counteract the work of Aristotle, and not never to be
accepted as a law. In turn, Newton turned around and done his work, which he himself openly says,
you know, there's much, much to be desired that to accomplish his work, he had to use a lot of
adjusted dimensions. And he also said, should the work of Galileo on falling bodies be incorrect,
that his work is automatically invalid. Then a lot coming over to Einstein placing his work on
Newton. And here again, Mr. Einstein's, you know, you've got to have the greatest respect for his
ability, his brilliance. But at the same time, he himself simply states in a public statement,
and it's known by anybody who studied physics or into physics that Einstein himself said,
should any of the laws that I have based my work on be found to be incorrect, my work cannot be
readjusted, it must be considered invalid. So you see, Einstein himself is not saying,
this is the way it is. He is saying, based on existing laws, and of course, those laws, which
was put forth by Galileo, Galileo did make the law, people have followed him did, and also with
Newton's law and motions, etc, etc. And so Albert Einstein is simply saying, if these laws are wrong,
his work is also incorrect. So what we're saying, so what you're saying that,
basically, almost all of present, present physics is based on a false assumption.
Absolutely, absolutely. The entire foundation of physics is based on a false belief assumption,
and the assumptions are incorrect. Now, what does this mean, practically speaking?
But this means that cosmology cannot be looked at correctly. This means that the electron theory
cannot be seen in its correctness. This means that nuclear technology is not understood.
If you go into particle physics, nuclear physics in these areas,
once you understand that the existing laws are incorrect, you quickly see them in a completely
different manner. Now, one person might say, well, if it's so incorrect, then why do we have nuclear
power? Could you comment? No, nuclear power is a technology based on the electron theory.
Okay, we go to the electron theory. The electron theory works. Of course it works.
But with the existing laws of physics, a person does not see that the technology involved with
the electron theory is really deadly, absolutely deadly. It should be a technology
that's completely rejected by any state or society.
Can you explain exactly the ramifications of nuclear power? For instance, are these
plants self-contained or are particles released through the retaining walls?
Yeah, okay. We spoke of this before, and there is no way you can
split an atom and contain the release particles. It simply cannot be done. It cannot be done with
their magnetic screens. It cannot be done with the containment vessel. It just cannot be done.
So what would happen then if we had a nuclear power plant, which we do,
releasing these particles? How many particles are there? Are there millions of tons released
per day? Oh, sure. Yeah, it gets into millions of tons when you take into consideration
the many, many factors involved. These release particles are released at a very high velocity,
and besides doing a lot of damage to the environment, to the inhabitants of planet Earth,
including plant life and animal life, including people, these particles, which are mass,
are actually absorbed by the magnetic fields of the Earth, and they become a part of that
magnetic field. This is clear with the electron theory, which includes power transmission, power
generation, radio stations, etc., etc., and with nuclear technology, this is grossly, grossly
magnified. So are you saying that our radio transmitters are actually broadcasting these
particles too? Yes, absolutely. Well, you see, nobody in the field will question that if you talk to
a radio engineer, a technician, an engineer, a physicist. I mean, this is pretty well accepted.
Sure, our transmitters are transmitting mass. Okay. Now, NASA has recently released a report
supposedly proving that chlorofluorocarbons are the cause of ozone depletion. Still others at NASA
believe it is not chlorofluorocarbons, but methane that is causing this problem. Are either of these
possible and do they actually have any proof for what they report?
